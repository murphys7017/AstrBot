# Upstream Reference Intake Ledger

This document records AstrBot upstream changes that were studied as reference material for
AG99. It is an intake and decision record, not a merge plan and not a measure of how closely
this repository follows upstream history. Keep appending to it when reviewing future upstream
updates, so old decisions remain easy to revisit without treating them as missing work.

## Reference Intake Board

Last updated: 2026-09-27

Last recorded comparison baseline:

- Local side: `master` at `f6e6c6845`; this AG99 fork is reviewed by behavior, not as an official upstream baseline.
- Upstream remote: `upstream` (`https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot`)
- Last local upstream snapshot checked: `upstream/master` at `26ff7673f53245043718d5121153bcd2a46b3a75` (2026-09-25).
- Reference snapshot status: local history was checked against this SHA. A fetch attempted on 2026-09-26 failed because the GitHub connection was reset, so commits after this snapshot are not verified.
- Git-only divergence is not tracked as a decision signal for this fork; topic and behavioral
  review remain the source of truth.
- The refreshed range contains 270 upstream commits after the previous `25cbd41e0` review baseline. Only the topics recorded below have been studied in this pass; unrecorded commits are reference material to inspect only when they relate to an AG99 need, not a backlog that must be cleared.

Important interpretation:

- This fork often rewrites upstream changes instead of cherry-picking them.
- A commit still shown as upstream-only may already be functionally absorbed if the local patch differs.
- Before adopting anything, compare by topic and behavior, not only by commit hash. A local
  rewrite may be preferable to copying the upstream implementation when AG99 has a different
  owner boundary.
- Historical entries preserve the Prompt terminology used at review time. References to `ContentPack`, Prompt Selector, shadow mode, or three targets are not current architecture; the current protected chain is `ContextPack -> target projection -> Render Profile -> Layout/PromptTree -> Provider Renderer -> Apply` for Router, Core Planner, Persona, and Core.

## 2026-09-27 conversation exclusion boundary follow-up

Reviewed upstream reference: `bb79c083e`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Dashboard pages in this fork already omit the stale `exclude_ids=astrbot` request
  parameter, so no frontend change was needed.
- The active SQLAlchemy SQLite implementation and the retained v3 migration reader now
  interpret every `exclude_ids` item as either an exact UMO or a complete platform
  segment (`<id>:`). SQL `LIKE` wildcard characters inside IDs are escaped.

Validation:

- Focused conversation-filter regression test passed, including `astrbot` versus
  `astrbotweb` and a literal percent-sign platform ID.
- Scoped Ruff, Python compilation, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-09-27 fullscreen console contrast follow-up

Reviewed upstream reference: `b13338dbd`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- The Dashboard's forced dark fullscreen console now explicitly supplies the
  readable foreground and Vuetify switch-track theme variables. This fixes
  light-theme fullscreen controls without changing the normal console theme.

Validation:

- Dashboard TypeScript typecheck and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-09-27 message-outline type-order follow-up

Reviewed upstream reference: `5935430b1`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Message outlines now classify `AtAll` before its `At` base class, displaying
  the intentional all-members marker instead of a generic literal `all` ID.

Validation:

- Focused message-event outline test, scoped Ruff, Python compilation, and
  `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-09-27 persisted conversation deletion follow-up

Reviewed upstream reference: `6dde01b7e`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Deleting the current conversation now reads the persisted selection through
  `get_curr_conversation_id()` when the in-memory session cache is cold, so a
  restart cannot turn a delete request into a silent no-op.

Validation:

- Focused conversation-manager regression test, scoped Ruff, Python
  compilation, and `git diff --check` passed.

## 2026-08-02 v4.27.0 Bailian rerank follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `9bb294d8c` (`v4.27.0`)

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- `3f9aa7478`: Bailian Rerank now identifies compatible endpoints by parsed URL path suffix, supports both `/compatible-api/v1/reranks` and `/compatible-mode/v1/reranks`, and uses the legacy `input/parameters` payload for `qwen3-rerank` when the endpoint is not compatible. The `instruct` parameter is retained for that model.

Validation:

- Bailian payload and endpoint-boundary tests: 3 passed.
- Focused Ruff, `py_compile`, and whitespace checks passed.

## 2026-08-02 v4.27.0 scheduler, provider, and response guard follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `9bb294d8c` (`v4.27.0`)

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- `80f3fd6de`: Cron scheduler startup now tracks database synchronization separately from scheduler state, so a job scheduled before `start()` cannot suppress the initial persistent-job load; shutdown resets both states for the next lifecycle.
- `d0e5e68c5`: NVIDIA's `minimaxai/minimax-m3` requests receive `max_tokens=8192` only when neither the normal payload nor custom extra body already provides a value. The override is applied to both streaming and non-streaming OpenAI-compatible requests.
- `12f2f5a09`: an invalid response-cleanup regex is logged and disabled for subsequent segments instead of aborting response decoration.

Validation for this follow-up:

- Cron manager and OpenAI provider suites: 98 passed.
- Focused Ruff, `py_compile`, and whitespace checks passed.

## 2026-08-02 v4.27.0 runtime, search, and platform guard follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `9bb294d8c` (`v4.27.0`)

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- `09a265ba1`: Python 3.14 and newer use the system `rg` executable for local file search because `python-ripgrep` is incompatible. The dependency is constrained to Python versions before 3.14; earlier versions retain the existing wrapper behavior.
- `d14989497`: BM25 is imported only when sparse retrieval must fall back from available FTS5 search, so normal module import and FTS5-only retrieval do not require it.
- `fb02c7273`: Tavily sends either explicit start/end dates or a relative `time_range`, never both; explicitly supplied dates are trimmed and take precedence.
- `8162d8437`: QQ Official streaming copies each yielded component into an owned send buffer, so mutation/reuse of the yielded `MessageChain` cannot erase leading characters.

Already equivalent locally:

- `3ca4c099e`: Discord slash-command validation already uses the correct `\w` character class rather than a double-escaped literal.
- `94a74e2ef`: the local FAISS storage import is already lazy, preserving startup when FAISS is unavailable or expensive to load.

Validation for this follow-up:

- Local filesystem, sparse retrieval, Tavily date-filter, QQ Official buffer, and existing QQ split tests: 19 passed.
- Full Web Search tool suite: 27 passed.
- Focused Ruff, `py_compile`, `uv lock --check`, and whitespace checks passed.

## 2026-08-02 v4.27.0 plugin lifecycle and stability follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `9bb294d8c` (`v4.27.0`)

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Plugin lifecycle:
  - `1ca3715c5`: repeated plugin loads bind event handlers and LLM tools idempotently instead of stacking `functools.partial` wrappers. Local activation state is also recomputed on every load, disabled loads clear stale plugin classes, and plugin-tool activation follows the plugin and per-tool configuration.
  - `2b21a6f63`: plugin reload detects already-loaded native extension modules and leaves them in place instead of attempting an unsafe `.pyd` / `.so` reload.
  - `c1a7b34ec`: plugin search no longer matches repository URLs.
- Stability and correctness:
  - `5e68ee767`: message outlines join component summaries without adding a trailing separator.
  - `7c2a2e9d8`: quoted-message depth and forward-fetch settings preserve explicit zero values; disabling forward fetch no longer emits a limit warning.
  - `d1ae378e2`: fresh FAISS indexes reject zero or negative embedding dimensions with an actionable provider-configuration error.
  - `fcce0105e`: dashboard statistics sample AstrBot process CPU in a worker thread and normalize it by logical CPU count instead of blocking the event loop with system-wide sampling.
  - `2035dbd07`: each rate-limited event captures its timestamp after acquiring the per-session lock, preventing queued events from using stale times.

Already equivalent locally:

- `1fcfffcc6`: local plugin uploads already send raw `FormData` directly to the Quart `/api/plugin/install-upload` route, so the upstream proxy-parser fix is not needed in this dashboard architecture.

Local compatibility decisions:

- The unrelated image-style changes bundled with the upstream handler-binding work were not included in the lifecycle fix.
- The fork-owned `TTSState` lifecycle, event API, delivery metadata, and Personal Runtime grouping remain unchanged.

Validation for this follow-up:

- Plugin lifecycle tests: 6 passed; native-extension reload guard: 1 passed.
- Stability tests for message outlines, quoted messages, FAISS, and concurrent rate limiting: 122 passed.
- Dashboard `/api/stat/get` process CPU test: 1 passed.
- Dashboard typecheck, focused Ruff, `py_compile`, and whitespace checks passed.

## 2026-08-02 v4.27.0 TTS and compatibility follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `9bb294d8c` (`v4.27.0`)

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- TTS and outbound media:
  - `7f1b6997e`: FishAudio exposes the `s2-pro` default and sends the selected model through the required HTTP header.
  - `2b90b9467`: MiMo TTS now defaults to `mimo-v2.5-tts` in both provider metadata and the provider fallback constant.
  - `4851b5050`: TTS, media conversion, WebChat attachment, upload fallback, and Live Chat WAV paths use compact timestamp IDs. UUIDs remain in place for logical message, request, conversation, task, and checkpoint identities.
  - `2be0b2054`: functionally present before this pass. Simulated streaming TTS, ordinary Pipeline TTS, and QQ Official outbound records do not register generated outbound audio for event-final cleanup. Inbound normalization files remain event-owned and are still cleaned after processing.
- Compatibility and correctness:
  - `3504ecb6f`: plugin config schemas and plugin i18n JSON accept an optional UTF-8 BOM, with explicit schema decode errors.
  - `d5620d94d`: inbound content safety checks include text extracted from Reply components while explicit outbound `check_text`, including an empty string, remains isolated from inbound content.
  - `11a5672ef`: concurrent embedding batches are reassembled by batch index, preserving input order when requests finish out of order.
  - `e36e161ab`: OpenAI-compatible responses with choices nested under `data` are validated and parsed before reporting empty model output.

Local compatibility decisions:

- The fork-owned `TTSState` lifecycle and output-segment protocol remains in place for now. This pass does not remove its event API, delivery metadata, or Personal Runtime grouping behavior.
- The workspace-tool prompt wording bundled into `4851b5050` is not part of the path-length fix and remains pending separate Prompt-architecture review.
- The remaining upstream commits after `25cbd41e0` are not implicitly classified as absorbed by this section.

Validation for this follow-up:

- TTS/provider and media tests: 37 passed.
- MiMo provider tests after the default-model update: 29 passed.
- WebChat path tests: 15 passed.
- Plugin BOM, quoted-content safety, embedding order, and nested OpenAI response checks: 14 passed.
- Focused Ruff, `py_compile`, and whitespace checks passed for every committed batch.

Known validation note:

- Directly importing a Pipeline stage before Interaction package initialization still exposes an existing package import cycle in this fork. The content-safety test uses the established application bootstrap order; resolving that package boundary is outside this compatibility batch.

## 2026-07-06 KB CRUD contract and pagination follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Knowledge-base CRUD contract:
  - `ea9e3421d`: local Quart `/api/kb/create` now accepts canonical `kb_name` and legacy `name`, still requires `embedding_provider_id`, and keeps the existing provider validation before creation.
  - Local Quart `/api/kb/update` now treats omitted fields as "preserve current value" while still allowing explicit `rerank_provider_id: null` to clear rerank provider selection.
- Knowledge-base list pagination:
  - `758e43273`: local `/api/kb/list` clamps `page` / `page_size` to positive integers, slices the in-memory manager list, and returns `items`, `page`, `page_size`, and `total`.
- Document list pagination and search:
  - Local `/api/kb/document/list` now accepts `page`, `page_size`, and `search`, returns `total`, and routes search through `KBHelper` into the SQLite metadata store.
  - Dashboard KB list and document table now use server-side pagination. The document table uses the local Vuetify `v-data-table-server` path and keeps the existing axios-based dashboard API style instead of importing upstream's generated `knowledgeApi`.

Local compatibility notes:

- The upstream FastAPI route/service/schema/OpenAPI generated client changes were not copied. This fork still serves these behaviors from `astrbot/dashboard/routes/knowledge_base.py`.
- The Yakumo prompt, memory, retrieval, and postprocess paths are not touched by this batch; only KB metadata/listing API behavior and its dashboard consumers changed.
- Explicit null clearing is intentionally limited to `rerank_provider_id`, matching the existing manager behavior. Omitted text/icon fields are preserved.

Validation for this follow-up:

- Python targeted tests: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache-local'; uv run pytest tests/unit/test_knowledge_base_quart_contract.py tests/unit/test_kb_document_cleanup.py tests/test_kb_import.py -q`
- Python focused lint: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache-local'; uv run ruff check astrbot/dashboard/routes/knowledge_base.py astrbot/core/knowledge_base/kb_db_sqlite.py astrbot/core/knowledge_base/kb_helper.py tests/unit/test_knowledge_base_quart_contract.py tests/unit/test_kb_document_cleanup.py`
- Frontend: `pnpm --dir dashboard typecheck`
- Hygiene: `git diff --check`

Known validation note:

- Focused pytest passed with existing third-party/plugin deprecation warnings from `jieba/pkg_resources`, Python `audioop`, and a local data plugin decorator.
- `git diff --check` passed; Git reported the repository's normal LF-to-CRLF working-copy notices on Windows.

## 2026-07-06 Workspace-local Skills follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Workspace-local Skills discovery:
  - `29d66b84b` / `6cac0881f` / `6fcac65bd`: `SkillManager` now discovers request-scoped skills from `<resolved_workspace>/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md`, with strict skill-name validation, exact `SKILL.md` casing, bounded frontmatter reads, and path checks that keep resolved skill files under the workspace skills root.
  - `b7da25978`: workspace-local Skills are disabled for group sessions.
  - This fork resolves the workspace through the local `astrbot.core.workspace` helper, so ChatUI project/shared/custom workspaces from the previous batch are honored. Non-WebChat sessions keep the legacy per-UMO workspace.
  - `SkillsCollector` resolves workspace-local and global skill inventory through the shared workspace policy; the removed Main Agent injection path is no longer a second consumer.
  - Workspace Skills override same-name local/plugin/sandbox Skills for the current request only. Explicit persona `skills=[]` still disables all Skills, including workspace Skills; persona allowlists continue to filter global/plugin/sandbox Skills without filtering request-scoped workspace Skills.

Local compatibility notes:

- Workspace Skills are local-runtime only and are not synced into sandbox sessions in this batch.
- Workspace Skills remain request-scoped: they are not written to `skills.json` and are not shown in the global Skills management page.
- Workspace Skill descriptions are sanitized before prompt rendering, matching the existing sandbox-only prompt-hardening path.

Documentation:

- Updated `docs/zh/use/skills.md` and `docs/en/use/skills.md` with skill-source priority, workspace scope, group-session behavior, and sandbox limitations.

Validation for this follow-up:

- Python targeted tests: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache-local'; uv run pytest tests/test_skill_metadata_enrichment.py tests/unit/test_astr_main_agent.py::TestEnsurePersonaAndSkills tests/unit/test_prompt_tree_renderer.py::test_render_engine_applies_persona_whitelists_to_capabilities -q`
- Python focused lint: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache-local'; uv run ruff check astrbot/core/skills/skill_manager.py astrbot/core/astr_main_agent.py astrbot/core/prompt/collectors/skills_collector.py astrbot/core/prompt/render/interfaces.py tests/test_skill_metadata_enrichment.py tests/unit/test_astr_main_agent.py tests/unit/test_prompt_tree_renderer.py`
- Hygiene: `git diff --check`

Known validation note:

- Focused pytest passed with existing third-party deprecation warnings from `jieba/pkg_resources` and Python `audioop`.

## 2026-07-06 ChatUI project workspace follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Duplicate proactive replies:
  - `de572e3fe`: when `send_message_to_user` sends plain text to the current session, the tool now records that text on the event and marks the event as having sent output. `RespondStage` skips a later same-text plain/Reply/At result so tool-delivered text is not sent twice.
- ChatUI project workspaces:
  - `e7d5be632`: project records now carry `workspace_type` and optional `workspace_path`, with existing projects defaulting to per-session workspace behavior.
  - Local workspace resolution now supports `session`, `project`, and `custom` modes. WebChat UMOs resolve their project through the existing ChatUI project relation table; non-WebChat sessions keep the legacy per-UMO workspace.
  - Local Python, shell, filesystem, and `send_message_to_user` file-resolution paths now use the resolved project/custom workspace when the tool context has database access. Legacy sync `workspace_root()` behavior is preserved for older call sites and tests.
  - The local main-agent workspace prompt and `EXTRA_PROMPT.md` lookup now use the resolved project/custom workspace without changing the Yakumo prompt/memory/postprocess pipeline.
  - The existing Quart `/api/chatui_project/*` routes now serialize workspace fields and validate custom paths through a small local service layer. Relative custom paths must stay under AstrBot workspaces; absolute custom paths are preserved, matching `6d798908a` / `20008f179`.
  - The customized ChatUI project dialog now exposes workspace mode and custom path fields without importing upstream's broader header/layout rewrite.

Local compatibility notes:

- Existing projects and sessions remain on `workspace_type=session`, so current per-session workspace behavior is unchanged until a project is explicitly switched to shared or custom workspace mode.
- Text file reads normalize CRLF/CR to LF before returning tool output, keeping filesystem-tool output stable on Windows after the workspace changes.

Deferred / intentionally not included in this follow-up:

- Upstream FastAPI service routes, generated OpenAPI types, MDI subset assets, and the large ChatUI header/layout redesign were not copied because this fork still uses local Quart routes and customized ChatUI layout.
- Workspace-local Skills discovery is not added in this batch because the current local `SkillManager` does not expose upstream's `list_workspace_skills()` surface; project workspace path resolution is now ready for that as a later focused batch.

Validation for this follow-up:

- Python: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache-local'; uv run pytest tests/unit/test_message_tools.py tests/unit/test_chatui_project_workspace.py tests/unit/test_python_tools.py tests/test_computer_fs_tools.py -q`

Known validation note:

## 2026-07-06 ChatUI attachment display follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- WebChat attachment filenames:
  - `b43cc6dee`: WebChat file sends now preserve both the stored UUID filename and the original display filename. Stored names remain available as `stored_filename` for file lookup, while `filename` is kept user-facing.
  - Message-part builders sanitize display filenames to a basename, reject unusable names such as `.` / `..`, and record `stored_filename` when the display name differs from the disk name.
- ChatUI rendering:
  - Frontend message parsing understands `stored_filename` and uses it for legacy `/api/chat/get_file` lookups while still showing the original filename.
  - File attachment presentation is shared through `attachmentPresentation.ts`, reducing duplicated extension/icon/color logic across the composer, main message list, legacy message list, and standalone chat.

Deferred / intentionally not included in this follow-up:

- Upstream FastAPI/OpenAPI generated type and schema changes were not copied because this fork still uses the local Quart dashboard route layer.
- MDI subset binary/font churn was not committed directly; the existing dashboard build scripts regenerate the subset from source usage.

Validation for this follow-up:

- Python: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache-local'; uv run pytest tests/unit/test_webchat_message_parts.py -q`
- Python lint: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache-local'; uv run ruff check astrbot/core/platform/sources/webchat/message_parts_helper.py astrbot/core/platform/sources/webchat/webchat_event.py tests/unit/test_webchat_message_parts.py`

Known validation note:

- The focused pytest run passed with existing third-party deprecation warnings from `jieba/pkg_resources` and Python `audioop`.

## 2026-07-06 Markdown streaming performance follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Markdown streaming performance:
  - `372b9f5bf`: chat Markdown rendering now uses a shared `MARKDOWN_RENDER_MAX_LIVE_NODES = 320` limit instead of disabling the live-node cap with `0`.
  - Applied to the local message Markdown part, threaded Markdown part, and reasoning timeline Markdown rendering, preserving the fork's existing ChatUI component layout.
  - Frontend Markdown dependencies were aligned with upstream for this fix: `markstream-vue` `1.0.5-beta.0`, `stream-markdown` `^0.0.16`, and `shiki` `^3.23.0`.

Validation for this follow-up:

- Frontend: `pnpm --dir dashboard typecheck`

## 2026-07-06 KB cleanup and retrieval resilience follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Knowledge base creation:
  - `aecee6fc9`: duplicate KB names are checked before insert, and concurrent unique-constraint collisions are converted to the same user-facing duplicate-name error instead of relying on fragile string matching.
- Retrieval resilience:
  - `468eea99c`: dense retrieval failures for an individual KB are logged and skipped even when only one KB was requested, allowing sparse retrieval/fusion paths to continue where possible.
  - Rerank provider selection now follows the initialized `vec_db.rerank_provider` instead of requiring the persisted provider ID to match, preserving behavior when the helper already resolved the usable provider.
- Knowledge base cleanup/statistics:
  - `e2f3b0008`: deleting a document also deletes related `KBMedia` rows in the metadata database before removing vector chunks.
  - KB chunk statistics now count vector documents with `metadata_filter={"kb_id": kb_id}`, so one KB's stats do not include chunks from other KBs.

Deferred / intentionally not included in this follow-up:

- `ea9e3421d` KB CRUD API contract and pagination alignment remains deferred because it is tied to upstream's FastAPI/OpenAPI service-route shape, while this fork still uses the local Quart dashboard routes.
- ChatUI project workspace and attachment-display work remains a separate frontend/backend feature batch.

Validation for this follow-up:

- Python: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache-local'; uv run pytest tests/unit/test_kb_manager_resilience.py tests/unit/test_kb_document_cleanup.py -q`
- Python lint: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache-local'; uv run ruff check astrbot/core/knowledge_base/kb_mgr.py astrbot/core/knowledge_base/kb_db_sqlite.py astrbot/core/knowledge_base/retrieval/manager.py tests/unit/test_kb_manager_resilience.py tests/unit/test_kb_document_cleanup.py`

Known validation note:

- The focused pytest run passed with the existing third-party `jieba/pkg_resources` deprecation warning.

## 2026-07-05 background wakeup and webhook response follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Background task wakeups:
  - `413340fca`: background tool/subagent result wakeups now build the main agent with the current UMO provider settings, including fallback chat model configuration and retry settings.
  - Rewritten into this fork's `FunctionToolExecutor._wake_main_agent_for_background_result()` path without changing the local Yakumo prompt/memory/postprocess request construction.
- Webhook response preservation:
  - `1e3b12acc`: QQ Official webhook URL validation (`op=13`) is accepted before regular event signature enforcement, matching the platform handshake behavior while keeping signature checks for normal events.
  - The local Quart unified webhook route already returns adapter responses directly, so plain-text and tuple responses are preserved instead of being wrapped into dashboard JSON envelopes. Added focused coverage for that behavior.
  - `ea19be1d0`: WeCom URL verification now returns a `text/plain` Quart response, so enterprise WeChat receives the raw echo string instead of JSON.

Deferred / intentionally not included in this follow-up:

- Upstream FastAPI `dashboard/api/platform.py` wrapper changes were not copied because this fork still uses the local Quart route implementation.
- Broader WeCom proactive-send metadata changes and upstream `MediaResolver` rewrites are left for separate platform/media batches; this follow-up only covers webhook response correctness.

## 2026-07-05 tool-call sanitation follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Tool loop robustness:
  - `25cbd41e0`: provider-returned malformed tool-call names (`None`, empty strings, or whitespace-only strings) are normalized to `__malformed_tool_name__` before execution handling.
  - The rewrite keeps the existing "tool not found" path responsible for reporting the bad call, instead of allowing malformed provider payloads to destabilize the agent loop.
  - Applied to both the primary/fallback final LLM response path and the `skills_like` requery/repair response path.

Deferred / intentionally not included in this follow-up:

- MiMo STT V2.5/WAV validation, QQ Official `None` retry, secure project update temp staging, ChatUI session ownership, FastAPI/OpenAPI migration, settings/theme refactors, and auth/TOTP expansion remain separate batches.

Validation for this follow-up:

- Python: `uv run pytest tests/test_tool_loop_agent_runner.py::test_sanitize_malformed_tool_call_names -q`
- Python lint: `uv run ruff check astrbot/core/agent/runners/tool_loop_agent_runner.py tests/test_tool_loop_agent_runner.py`

## 2026-07-05 MiMo STT and QQ Official retry follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- MiMo STT compatibility:
  - `c9eed7b65`: the default MiMo STT model is now `mimo-v2.5-asr`, replacing the retired `mimo-v2-omni` default.
  - Dedicated ASR models keep the existing bare `input_audio` payload; non-ASR multimodal MiMo models add transcription system/user prompts required by the v2.5 audio-understanding path.
  - The local download/AMR/SILK conversion flow is preserved, with an added RIFF/WAVE header check before sending audio to the API. Tencent SILK bytes that survive conversion now fail locally with an actionable error instead of surfacing as an opaque API 400.
  - Non-WAV local/downloaded audio paths are converted to WAV before validation, so the new header check does not narrow existing MiMo STT compatibility for common formats such as MP3.
- QQ Official reliability:
  - `cc0b34750`: QQ Official C2C send and group/C2C media upload paths now treat API `None` responses as transient failures and retry through the existing tenacity retry policy.
  - Message-send `None` retries are capped at 3 attempts; media upload retries keep the existing 5-attempt behavior. Existing final return behavior is preserved (`None` for skipped media/message send after retry exhaustion).

Deferred / intentionally not included in this follow-up:

- Broader updater service-layer migration is left out because this fork still uses the current Quart route implementation.

## 2026-07-05 ChatUI session read ownership follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- ChatUI session privacy:
  - `041fba4df`: reading a ChatUI session now first verifies that the session exists and that `session.creator` matches the authenticated dashboard user.
  - Rewritten into this fork's local Quart `ChatRoute.get_session()` path instead of upstream's newer `ChatService` layer.
  - Foreign sessions now return `Permission denied` before message history, project metadata, thread metadata, or running-state information can be exposed.

Deferred / intentionally not included in this follow-up:

- The upstream `/api/v1/chat/sessions/{session_id}` service-route shape was not copied because this fork still serves the current `/api/chat/get_session` route for this behavior.

## 2026-07-05 secure update staging follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Project update staging:
  - `30426c4f6`: project update downloads now stage core/WebUI archives inside a per-run `TemporaryDirectory` under AstrBot's private temp path (`get_astrbot_temp_path()/updates`) instead of a fixed shared system-temp `updates` directory.
  - The staging parent is created with restricted permissions where supported, and a symlink at that location is removed before creating the directory.
  - Temporary update archives are cleaned up by the temporary-directory context after download, verification, apply, dependency update, and optional restart handling complete.

Local adaptation notes:

- Rewritten into this fork's local `astrbot/dashboard/routes/update.py` route instead of upstream's `UpdateService` class.
- Existing local atomic update behavior is preserved: WebUI and core archives are both downloaded and verified before either package is applied.

## 2026-07-05 upstream test/docs-only review

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Reviewed with no local runtime rewrite:

- `3b8caf37e`: POSIX file URI root-preservation test coverage only. The local runtime path handling was not changed in this batch.
- `85b653b6f`: upstream documentation note about cross-platform compatibility and Python version support. No local code behavior to absorb.

Validation:

- No dedicated validation required; these were reviewed as test/docs-only upstream changes.

## 2026-07-05 MCP runtime reliability follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- ModelScope MCP sync:
  - `89b80a6ca`: syncing ModelScope MCP servers now enables only servers that were actually accepted into the local config. Entries without a server name, without operational URLs, or without a usable URL are skipped instead of later causing a `KeyError` during enable.
  - The loaded MCP config is deep-copied before modification, so fallback/default config objects are not mutated in place.
- MCP lifecycle cleanup:
  - `3ce66576f`: MCP client connect, tool-list registration, lifecycle wait, and cleanup now run in one lifecycle task. `_start_mcp_server()` waits for a connection-complete signal, so initialization still reports success/failure synchronously while cleanup remains in the same task that entered the MCP client contexts.
  - Timeout and cancellation paths cancel the lifecycle task, gather it, and remove runtime bookkeeping. Failed connection/list-tools paths clean up the client and remove runtime state before surfacing the original error.

Local adaptation notes:

- Rewritten against this fork's existing `_MCPServerRuntime` / read-only runtime view structure.
- Unlike the upstream patch text, cleanup is awaited directly in the lifecycle task rather than wrapped with `asyncio.shield(coro)`, because shielding a coroutine schedules a separate task and would reintroduce cross-task cleanup in this code path.

Deferred / intentionally not included in this follow-up:

- `6d798908a` / `20008f179` custom workspace path changes were reviewed but not applied because this fork does not currently have upstream's `astrbot/core/workspace.py` / ChatUI project workspace service shape. Absorbing them would require the broader project-workspace feature batch.

## 2026-07-05 scan registration custom bot ID follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `25cbd41e0`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Platform scan registration UI:
  - `9f50c900b`: scan-based platform creation now lets the user edit the platform/bot ID before completing the QR registration flow.
  - Rewritten into the local `AddNewPlatform.vue` shape for the existing scan flows in this fork: Lark, DingTalk, and Weixin OC.
  - Empty IDs, whitespace, `:`, and `!` are rejected through the shared `isPlatformIdValid()` check, so invalid IDs cannot be saved or used in generated UMOP routes.
  - Once the user manually edits the scan ID, QR registration callbacks no longer overwrite it with bot-name/random suffix data. Switching platform templates resets that manual-edit guard.
  - Added Chinese, English, and Russian dashboard strings for the new ID field and validation errors.

Deferred / intentionally not included in this follow-up:

- Upstream's QQ Official QR scan UI path was not introduced in this batch because the local platform creation dialog does not currently expose that scan branch. Absorbing it should be handled with the broader QQ Official platform UI alignment work if needed.

## 2026-07-05 web search API key failover follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `b43cc6dee`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Web search provider reliability:
  - `8a31cf01f`: multi-key web search providers now fail over to the next configured API key for key-specific HTTP failures: `401`, `403`, `429`, and Tavily quota status `432`.
  - The behavior was rewritten around a local `_run_with_key_failover()` helper and applied to Tavily search/extract, BoCha, Brave, Firecrawl search/scrape, and Exa search/contents.
  - Non-key-specific failures such as `500` still fail fast, so provider outages are not hidden by rotating through unrelated keys.
  - `_KeyRotator` still preserves the earlier local guard for runtime key-list shrinkage.

Deferred / intentionally not included in this follow-up:

- ChatUI project workspaces and attachment-display changes, KB CRUD contract/pagination/cleanup, FastAPI/OpenAPI service migration, TOTP/auth expansion, settings/theme refactors, and plugin install-source tracking remain separate batches.

## 2026-07-04 small runtime and dashboard compatibility follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `b43cc6dee`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Local file tools:
  - `41f896030`: `astrbot_file_read_tool` now returns a clear directory-path error before trying to read a directory as a file. This keeps local workspace path validation intact and only improves the post-normalization error path.
- Plugin reload:
  - `152fb3be8`: specified-plugin reload now skips `_unbind_plugin()` for deactivated plugins, preserving their registered LLM tools until the plugin is explicitly re-enabled. Full reload behavior is unchanged.
- Discord slash commands:
  - `029e9c84a`: Discord command registration now accepts lowercase Unicode word characters, underscores, hyphens, and apostrophes instead of only ASCII lowercase names.
- Plugin update display:
  - `b5784abc5`: installed plugins are marked as updatable only when the marketplace version is a known newer semantic version, including pre-release-to-stable transitions. Unknown or older marketplace versions no longer show false update badges.

Deferred / intentionally not included in this follow-up:

## 2026-07-04 plugin embedded page bridge parity follow-up

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `b43cc6dee`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Plugin embedded WebUI pages:
  - The main plugin page implementation was already present locally: page discovery under `pages/<page>/index.html`, scoped asset tokens, bridge SDK injection, iframe rendering, card/sidebar entries, theme context, and plugin-page docs.
  - This follow-up aligned the remaining bridge details with upstream while preserving the local Quart dashboard and `/api/plug/<plugin>/<endpoint>` dynamic plugin API path.
  - `bridge.upload()` now sends file payloads through `ArrayBuffer` plus `postMessage` transfer lists instead of relying on cloning `File`/`Blob` objects across the sandbox boundary.
  - Plugin-page SSE now uses authenticated `fetch()` stream reading, preserves SSE `event:` names as `eventType`, supports explicit abort cleanup, and reports response-body errors through the bridge.

Local adaptation notes:

- Upstream's FastAPI `plugin_page_service.py` layout was not copied; the equivalent behavior remains in this fork's existing Quart `astrbot/dashboard/routes/plugin.py` implementation.
- Sidebar MDI icon support and plugin page theme propagation were already present locally, so this follow-up only touched the bridge transport layer.

- Python: `uv run pytest tests/test_dashboard.py -q -k "plugin_page"`

## 2026-07-04 small upstream fixes batch

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `b43cc6dee`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Web search:
  - `ae29a7eaf`: added Exa web search support through the local builtin tool system: `web_search_exa`, `exa_get_contents`, `websearch_exa_key`, provider metadata, main-agent mounting, and WebChat citation/ref parsing.
  - `534ad0ccc`: `_KeyRotator` now resets a stale index when the configured key list shrinks, preventing index errors after config edits.
- Local shell/runtime stability:
  - `b5e29511a`: local shell execution now uses `Popen.communicate()` so Windows timeouts can terminate the whole process tree via `taskkill /F /T /PID` before falling back to killing the parent process.
- Desktop-managed update/restart guard:
  - `b673cb375`: desktop-managed backends (`ASTRBOT_DESKTOP_MANAGED=1`) now reject WebUI core restart/update actions and bottom-level updater reboot attempts with a clear message.
  - `3b41a870f`: non-frozen Windows restarts now spawn a new console process and exit the current process instead of `execv` reuse.
- Download safety:
  - `70a52ea6d`: `download_file()` now rejects non-200 responses in both normal and SSL-fallback paths before writing a target file.

Local adaptation notes:

- Dashboard restart/update guards were rewritten into this fork's Quart route layer instead of upstream's newer FastAPI service layout.
- The Exa integration uses the existing local prompt/provider flow and only participates through the existing `provider_settings.web_search` provider switch.
- The download helper preserves this fork's existing Chinese progress output and progress callback payload shape.

Deferred / intentionally not included in this batch:

- FastAPI/OpenAPI migration, settings-system refactor, auth/TOTP, theme-mode refactor, ChatUI workspace/attachment-display work, KB API pagination/cleanup, and broader plugin install/source tracking remain separate topic batches.

## 2026-07-04 provider/media compatibility batch

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `b43cc6dee`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Media format preservation:
  - `c6b2c65b0` / `d6738a03f`: image MIME detection and compression now preserve PNG/GIF/WebP/BMP where possible instead of forcing JPEG. Alpha images are compressed as PNG, animated images are left unchanged, and JPEG output keeps explicit quality/subsampling settings.
  - Local platform sends now use detected image formats where this fork previously hardcoded JPEG: Satori data URLs, WebChat attachment filenames, Slack upload filenames, and Mattermost upload content types.
  - `astrbot/core/computer/file_read_utils.py` now treats non-compressible images as "keep original" rather than failing the read path.
- Provider compatibility:
  - `8213c14cc`: Anthropic payloads now remove orphaned/stale `tool_result` blocks, merge consecutive same-role messages, and keep valid tool results before user text.
  - `3db778ff0` / `d4fa9d3d5`: OpenAI-compatible payload sanitization now keeps reasoning-only assistant history, drops orphaned or duplicate tool messages, and returns an empty `TokenUsage` when the provider omits usage.
  - `3667487dd`: DeepSeek V4 reasoning-history handling now recognizes marker substrings such as proxy model names containing `deepseek-v4`.
  - `b8f4c7d51`: MiMo STT now sends audio-only `input_audio` data URLs, removes the old STT prompt fields, and falls back to `reasoning_content` when `content` is empty.
- Tencent SILK:
  - `4cf210e50`: Tencent SILK encoding now follows upstream's `silk-python` / `pysilk` path, including mono downmix, unsupported-rate resampling to 24 kHz, 16-bit PCM conversion, and `tencent=True` output.
  - The local `audio_to_tencent_silk_base64` helper was kept but rewired to the same `wav_to_tencent_silk` implementation so this fork no longer mixes `pilk` and `pysilk`.

Local adaptation notes:

- Upstream's newer `MediaResolver` / `_LocalMediaFile` abstractions are not present in this fork, so media behavior was rewritten against the current local `Image`, `Record`, `compress_image`, and platform send APIs.
- No FastAPI/OpenAPI, settings-system, dashboard theme, auth/TOTP, or formal version-bump changes were pulled into this batch.

Known validation gap:

- A broader targeted run, `uv run pytest tests/test_openai_source.py tests/test_anthropic_kimi_code_provider.py tests/test_mimo_api_sources.py tests/test_media_utils.py -q`, still has pre-existing `tests/test_openai_source.py` failures unrelated to this batch: missing `_summarize_messages` / `_summarize_completion`, Windows `file://` path separator expectations, and localhost file-URI image materialization.

## 2026-07-04 post-v4.26.4 safety and compatibility batch

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `b43cc6dee`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Security / path confinement:
  - `5266d170a`: local Quart KB upload route now sanitizes uploaded filenames with basename extraction before composing `kb_upload_*` temp paths, including Windows separator handling and empty-name fallback.
  - `3c7956e8c`: local plugin upload route now sanitizes uploaded plugin archive filenames before composing `plugin_upload_*` temp paths.
- Scheduling correctness:
  - `df4d93d72`: recurring cron jobs now normalize standard crontab numeric weekdays (`0`/`7` as Sunday) to APScheduler weekday names before scheduling. Added focused coverage for Sunday scheduling and weekday normalization.
- OpenAPI / auth compatibility:
  - `967ed01cf`: local API key scope allowlist and Settings UI now include the `data` scope.
  - `b7cadfe70`: local dashboard auth middleware now validates dashboard JWT and plugin-page asset token candidates independently, so an expired/invalid dashboard token no longer prevents a valid scoped plugin-page asset token from loading protected assets.
- Pipeline stop semantics:
  - `9daf8f0a8`: `OnWaitingLLMRequestEvent` stop results now return before acquiring the session lock. This preserves local Yakumo prompt/memory/postprocess flow and only changes the pre-lock stop behavior.

Already present / no local change needed:

- `0cfe4163c`: local defaults already use `max_context_length = -1` and `dequeue_context_length = 1`.

Deferred from this first post-v4.26.4 pass:

- Login-page public version details (`421d71804`) are left for a dedicated dashboard pass because this fork's frontend API layer differs from upstream and the upgrade-recovery dialog already covers the highest-value version-mismatch path.
- FastAPI/OpenAPI service-layer migrations, ChatUI project workspace/attachment display work, broader plugin install/update source tracking, and KB API contract pagination/cleanup changes remain for later topic batches. Provider/media compatibility was handled in the 2026-07-04 provider/media compatibility batch.

## 2026-07-04 upgrade recovery and auth compatibility batch

Reviewed upstream baseline: cached `upstream/master` at `756469a39`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Upgrade recovery / restart compatibility:
  - `19864b3f8`: added a local `UpgradeRecoveryDialog` mounted from `App.vue`, adapted to the current Quart dashboard and axios-based frontend. It detects mismatched core/WebUI versions, offers a restart action, and polls `/api/stat/start-time` until recovery completes.
  - `12b1b2782`: folded the restart-wait hardening into the local recovery dialog flow so interrupted updates can recover without forcing a fresh manual login loop.
- Login / auth-session compatibility:
  - `d5f563128` / `08fc56517`: instead of upstream's v1 auth client path, the local `auth` store now uses the existing `/api/auth/login` response token to probe `/api/stat/version`. On detected core/WebUI mismatch it stores a temporary recovery token in session storage and opens the recovery dialog rather than proceeding into a broken post-login state.
  - `cdfb0bdf9`: rewritten into the current `dashboard/src/main.ts` axios/fetch bootstrap so same-origin API `401` responses clear stale dashboard session state and redirect back to `/auth/login`, while still excluding auth challenge endpoints.

Intentionally not copied literally:

- Upstream `dashboard/src/api/http.ts` / `dashboard/src/api/v1.ts` changes were not merged as-is because this fork still uses the older axios bootstrap in `dashboard/src/main.ts` plus Quart routes. The behavior was rewritten against the local structure instead of introducing upstream's API client layer.
- Upstream TOTP / recovery-code login form staging was not pulled into this batch. This fork's current dashboard auth flow does not yet mirror the upstream multi-stage login UI, and the practical recovery value here was the upgrade/session mismatch handling rather than the full auth-surface rewrite.

Validation for this batch:

- Frontend: `pnpm --dir dashboard typecheck`
- Hygiene: `git diff --check`

## 2026-06-18 post-v4.26.0-beta.4 small update/restart batch

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `2c5165e92`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Update and dashboard delivery:
  - `dd46cce09`: rewritten into the existing Quart update route as a staged local flow that downloads core and WebUI archives first, validates both zip packages, then applies core extraction and dashboard extraction separately. This keeps the local lifecycle/restart contract and avoids pulling in the upstream FastAPI/service refactor.
  - The local updater now exposes `download_update_package(...)` and `apply_update_package(...)` so the dashboard route can keep the update process atomic at the archive/application boundary.
  - Dashboard archive extraction is now isolated in `extract_dashboard(...)` with path traversal protection.
- Runtime visibility:
  - `a93862046`: dashboard startup log now reports when the WebUI static bundle is missing instead of always printing a misleading ready banner.
- Frontend input/update UX:
  - `f66215b36`: ChatInput now preserves IME-composed characters by deferring prompt emission until composition ends and then re-running input synchronization.
  - The existing update dialog now keeps restart feedback visible across backend restarts, waits for `/api/stat/start-time` to change, and only auto-reloads after the process is back.

Validation for this batch:

- Python: focused `pytest tests/test_dashboard.py -q` plus targeted lint on touched backend files.
- Frontend: `pnpm --dir dashboard typecheck`.
- Final hygiene: `git diff --check`.

Deferred / intentionally not merged in this batch:

- Upstream FastAPI/OpenAPI migration and updater service split were not merged; behavior was rewritten into the current Quart route instead.
- Settings-system restructuring, theme-mode refactors, auth/TOTP expansion, and other broad WebUI architecture changes remain out of scope for this batch.

## 2026-06-18 follow-up small compatibility fixes

Reviewed upstream baseline: `upstream/master` at `2c5165e92`

Local commit: `d070b4ccd`

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- Startup password reset:
  - `4f5075e60`: local CLI `astrbot run` and direct `main.py` startup now accept `--reset-password`, setting a startup env flag early enough for config loading to rotate the generated dashboard password and reprint it through the existing startup path.
- Persona tool-selection correctness:
  - `fda516145`: this fork already had `NOT_GIVEN`-based persona update semantics in the DB/manager path, but persona creation still collapsed `tools=[]` / `skills=[]` into `None`. The Quart persona route now preserves explicit empty lists so “disable all tools/skills” no longer turns into “use all tools/skills”.
- Backup/onboarding frontend repair:
  - `d3b52356a`: the relevant local breakage was the backup chunk uploader forcing a manual `multipart/form-data` header, which can drop the browser-generated boundary and break Quart file parsing. The upload now lets the browser generate the correct multipart request.

Reviewed and intentionally left unchanged:

- `dashboard/src/views/WelcomePage.vue` did not need the upstream `systemConfigApi.runtime()` switch in this fork. The local page still uses Quart `/api/config/get` and `/api/config/abconf`, which are valid in the current architecture and do not reproduce the upstream FastAPI/OpenAPI adapter mismatch.

Validation for this batch:

- Python core/config/CLI: `pytest tests/test_main.py tests/test_cli_run.py tests/unit/test_config.py -q --basetemp .test-tmp\pytest-core-compat -p no:cacheprovider`
- Dashboard route suite was also attempted with `tests/test_dashboard.py`; this environment currently fails while constructing `Quart("dashboard")` with a Flask namespace-package `StopIteration`, before the relevant route assertions run. The earlier no-`basetemp` attempt was additionally blocked by temp-directory permissions.
- Frontend: `pnpm --dir dashboard typecheck`
- Lint: focused `uv run ruff check` on touched Python files, with `UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache`

- Plugin/tool ownership and activation:
  - `736bc93b2` / `3ca6f241a` / `992aea986`: subdirectory plugin tools now resolve back to the registered plugin root module instead of drifting to ambiguous handler paths; empty module-path edge cases are handled defensively.
  - `fadada3d6`: plugin on/off now correctly matches tools under child modules such as `...main.tools.*`.
  - `6f88ad9a3`: reviewed but not copied literally. This fork already enforces per-tool permissions at the executor entrypoint, so no wrapper rewrite was needed; focused coverage was kept on the local guard path instead of introducing wrapper/tool-type risk.
- Provider/agent fixes:
  - `690b184a6`: OpenAI embedding API base normalization now preserves explicit version suffixes like `/v1beta` or `/v1alpha1` while still appending `/v1` when the path is genuinely versionless.
  - `33cab38c3`: Gemini multi-turn tool-call context now keeps assistant text/thinking parts alongside tool calls and avoids emitting a duplicate empty thought-only part when the thought signature already lives on tool-call entries.
- Stability and ops:
  - `12d4a613b`: config writes now use atomic temp-file replace semantics with cleanup on failure; initial config creation goes through the same path.
  - `dd828c99f`: local Python execution now runs inside the per-session workspace for `LocalPythonTool`; sandbox `PythonTool` behavior was intentionally left unchanged.
  - `898c800c9`: skills batch upload no longer forces a broken manual multipart header, allowing the browser boundary to be sent correctly.
  - `80af9e0c1`: CLI version now reads from core `VERSION` instead of a stale hardcoded literal.
  - `d0323196f` / `2eee83383`: GitHub proxy presets were refreshed to the current valid list.
  - `f19f623a2`: changelog dialog now handles in-dialog anchor links by scrolling within the modal instead of jumping the whole page.
- Documentation/governance:
  - This ledger is now aligned to upstream baseline `2c5165e92`.
  - Historical hash typo references should use `b0bb5c547` (not `b0bb5c747`).

Validation for this batch:

- Python targeted tests cover plugin tool ownership, Gemini conversation shaping, OpenAI embedding base normalization, config atomic-write cleanup, local Python workspace execution, and existing tool-permission guard behavior.
- Frontend validation includes `pnpm --dir dashboard typecheck`.

Recently absorbed by rewrite:

- Provider/runtime compatibility:
  - OpenAI SDK httpx alignment, empty reasoning handling, DeepSeek v4 reasoning history, `None` tool arguments, context-length retry matching, MiniMax TTS timber-weight fallback, fallback `max_context_tokens`.
- Embedding providers:
  - NVIDIA NIM Embedding and Ollama Embedding source adapters, provider manager imports, default Web config templates, locale hints, and `input_type` metadata.
- Outbound media and platform fixes:
  - Active replies pass image inputs through LLM requests, Tencent SILK magic-byte detection, stricter `SendMessageToUserTool` path handling, Weixin OC media send failure surfacing.
- Plugin/runtime metadata:
  - Handler kwargs preservation, plugin `pages` metadata, repeated install cleanup/error-tracking behavior.
- Dashboard and upload handling:
  - Chat upload filename sanitization, IME Enter guard, provider status test error display, console auto-scroll sync, console log layout improvements, and bundled dashboard fallback when `data/dist` is stale.
- Shipyard Neo:
  - Empty profile now means auto-select; any non-empty explicit profile is honored.
- 2026-05-18 follow-up review found these upstream fixes already present in this fork before this batch:
  - Windows updater zip root path normalization.
  - Blank prompt skipping knowledge-base retrieval.
  - Startup warning when default chat provider is missing or invalid.
  - Anthropic custom headers and system-prompt compatibility.
  - OpenRouter `reasoning` key override.
  - Empty-string reasoning content support.
  - Telegram media group scheduled-job exception logging.
- 2026-05-18 small safety/stability review found these upstream fixes already present in this fork:
  - T2I template SSTI validation and template editor error feedback.
  - Gemini chat provider managed `httpx.AsyncClient`.
  - GitHub dashboard fallback download URL using `AstrBot-{tag}-dashboard.zip`.
  - Baidu web search API key hidden unless web search is enabled.
- 2026-05-24 simple-candidate review found these upstream fixes already present in this fork:
  - SOCKS-compatible updater downloads via `httpx` with `trust_env=True`.
  - MCP input schema normalization for property-level boolean `required` fields.
  - `RegexFilter` accepts both strings and compiled `re.Pattern` instances.
  - `rate_limit_count <= 0` no longer crashes rate-limit checking.
  - Cron run timestamps are serialized with timezone information.
  - Bocha search disables brotli response encoding for aiohttp compatibility.
  - QQ Official API retries transient OS/timeout errors.
  - Platform adapter filter types include newer adapters such as `webchat`, `weixin_oc`, and webhook variants.
  - Metrics upload can be disabled by config or `ASTRBOT_DISABLE_METRICS`.
  - Video attachments, oversized image compression, `None` system prompts, WeCom duplicate text events, file-read modalities, and register decorator kwargs fixes were already present.
- 2026-06-05 v4.25.2 small/compat parity batch (20 upstream commits rewritten locally):
  - `9fc03fa95` `astrbot/dashboard/routes/file.py`: removed useless no-op `pass` log statement; behavior unchanged.
  - `49036f8f9` `astrbot/core/tools/message_tools.py`: `SendMessageToUserTool` description now documents full tool semantics so the model can reliably distinguish tool-emitted vs user-emitted messages.
  - `92b2ce872` `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`: bumped `docker/setup-qemu-action` from `v4.0.0` to `v4.1.0`; minor CI chore.
  - `fbc0633cd` zh terminology alignment: `astrbot/core/config/default.py` and the `zh-CN` config-metadata locale now use `词元（Tokens）` instead of `令牌` for `max_context_tokens`/`max_tokens` hints.
  - `61b6813dc` dashboard FAQ + download naming: `docs/{en,zh}/faq.md` and `astrbot/dashboard/routes/static_file.py` now point users at the real `AstrBot-{tag}-dashboard.zip` archive name instead of the non-existent `dist.zip`.
  - `6a467fc04` `astrbot/core/provider/sources/whisper_api_source.py`: `open(..., "rb")` for the temp audio file is now wrapped in a `with` context manager so the handle is closed even on error.
  - `d912e1497` `astrbot/core/utils/media_utils.py`: `ensure_wav` returns the original path immediately when the source file is missing, instead of letting `subprocess` raise an opaque `FileNotFoundError`. Fixed the failing `test_whisper_api_source.py::test_get_text_converts_opus_files_to_wav_before_transcription` test that depended on this guard.
  - `f01dc474e` `astrbot/core/provider/sources/gemini_embedding_source.py`: batch text inputs are now wrapped in `google.genai.types.Content(parts=[Part(text=...)])` to match the current Gemini SDK embedding API contract.
  - `072691877` `astrbot/core/provider/sources/openai_embedding_source.py`: when the configured model is not a Qwen embedding model, the unsupported `dimensions` parameter is dropped from the request to avoid 400 errors from non-Qwen OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoints (notably SiliconFlow).
  - `bd597859f` `astrbot/core/provider/sources/openai_source.py` + test: extracted `_IMAGE_FORMAT_MIME_TYPES`, `_detect_image_format`, `_image_format_to_mime_type`, and `_base64_image_ref_to_data_url` so that `base64://` references are wrapped as a data URL with the **actual** detected MIME (PNG/GIF/WebP/etc.) instead of always defaulting to `image/jpeg`. File-image references now go through the same detector with a `mode="safe"|"strict"` policy. `tests/test_openai_source.py` gains a focused PNG-preservation case. Invalid `base64://` content gracefully falls back to `image/jpeg` (preserving the historical calling contract), and invalid local files return `None`/`raise ValueError` per mode.
  - `7d45a247d` `astrbot/core/message/components.py` (Reply): `Reply.toDict()` now returns `{"type": "reply", "data": {"id": str(self.id)}}` per the OneBot V11 spec instead of leaking `_session_id` and `sender_id`. Added `tests/unit/test_aiocqhttp_reply.py` with three focused tests covering OneBot V11 format, `str(id)` coercion, and that `_session_id`/`sender_id` are not leaked.
  - `4bb1b897d` `astrbot/core/message/components.py` (Record): `Record._decode_file_uri` and `Record._resolve_file_source` are introduced so record components can decode `file://` URIs and fall back through `(file, url, path)` to a real local path. Fixed a latent `.jpg`→`.wav` extension bug introduced by the previous fallback chain.
  - `9a648eb42` `astrbot/core/platform/sources/wecom_ai_bot/wecomai_event.py`: added an opt-in `strip_result=True` parameter to `_extract_plain_text_from_chain`. Default remains `True`; streaming sites that need raw whitespace now pass `False`.
  - `e4044cc5a` `astrbot/core/astr_main_agent.py` + `astrbot/core/pipeline/process_stage/method/agent_sub_stages/internal.py`: empty-message detection now also counts `event.message_obj.message` so reply/quoted messages can satisfy the gate and skip a no-op LLM call. Mirrors upstream's "re-query empty response" guard.
  - `1ad2b2c38` `astrbot/core/pipeline/process_stage/method/agent_sub_stages/internal.py`: provider stats persistence now retries SQLite `OperationalError` (`database is locked`) with bounded exponential backoff (`PROVIDER_STATS_SQLITE_LOCK_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3`, `PROVIDER_STATS_SQLITE_LOCK_RETRY_BASE_DELAY=0.2`), preventing occasional stats-write races from dropping usage records.
  - `4b097011c` reviewed but intentionally diverged: upstream treats empty `modalities=[]` as unconfigured/full capability, while this fork keeps `modalities=[]` as text-only. The local policy is implemented consistently across main-agent modality checks, tool-loop request/context sanitization, cached tool images, and shared context sanitizers. The upstream test fix in `tests/test_tool_loop_agent_runner.py` (`SimpleNamespace` mock exposes `mime_type`) was absorbed.
  - `e5d7b4309` `astrbot/dashboard/routes/plugin.py`: `_apply_plugin_page_security_headers` skips `X-Frame-Options` and `frame-ancestors` only when `ASTRBOT_LAUNCHER` env is set to `1` or `true`, so the Tauri launcher can keep embedding plugin pages while standalone deployments keep the existing CSP posture.
  - `25b134444` `dashboard/src/views/ConsolePage.vue` + 3 i18n: replaced the inline `status` flash for pip-install results with `useToast`; added localized `installSuccess` / `installFailed` / `requestFailed` keys.
  - `d16e6a869` `dashboard/src/components/shared/ListConfigItem.vue`: the single-item setter no longer trims its value, so values like `"hello world"` or a single space are preserved; the existing watch filter still trims incoming entries so pure-whitespace values are still rejected.
  - `b0bb5c547` `dashboard/src/composables/useMessages.ts` + `ReasoningSidebar.vue` + `ReasoningBlock.vue` + 3 i18n: new `reasoningActivityCounts` / `reasoningActivityTitle` exports aggregate think + tool call counts; static `tm("reasoning.thinking")` titles are replaced with dynamic titles; added `thinkSummary` / `toolSummary` / `summarySeparator` i18n keys for en/zh/ru.
  - All 20 commits were rewritten locally to preserve Yakumo's prompt/memory/postprocess/interaction architecture. No upstream-cherry-pick was used. `git cherry` will still show these as `+` because patch contents differ; the functional absorption is recorded here.
- 2026-06-05 follow-up batch 4/5/6:
  - `c89ac6189` / `def81530b`: MiniMax Token Plan now defaults to `MiniMax-M3` and fetches `/v1/models` dynamically when an API key is available, with a local fallback list so tests/offline startup remain deterministic.
  - `8353fe160`: Anthropic `tool_choice` is normalized to the native Anthropic schema (`auto`/`any`/`none`/dict tool choice), while OpenAI-style `required` maps to `any`; unsupported string `tool` falls back to `auto`.
  - `01a47b836`: QQ Official Webhook caches selected raw webhook extra fields (`union_openid`, `message_scene`) by message ID and attaches them to the committed event.
  - `85ec7a969`: preprocess now materializes and STT-transcribes `Record` components inside `Reply.chain`, using the local shared `transcribe_record` path instead of duplicating provider calls.
  - `90a3a2171`: template-list config validation and schema lookup now support file fields under `<field>.templates.<template>.*`; the dashboard editor supports `display_item`, hidden list hints, and `file` defaults.
  - `cea37707a`: configured provider model entries can derive capability metadata from the saved provider config when static model metadata is missing.
  - `0da17485b`: plugin failed-load cleanup now removes exact plugin module paths, stale metadata, handlers, tools, and plugin-registered platform adapters; legacy unregistered plugins fail with a clear error instead of `IndexError`.
  - `24f568b14`: active-agent cron jobs can be run manually, disabled jobs can be run on demand, run-once jobs are not deleted by manual runs, and delivery session is optional. The follow-up frontend pass wires the existing local `CronJobPage.vue` to manual run, last-error visibility, and optional delivery session without taking upstream's broad page rewrite.
- 2026-06-05 follow-up batch 3/4/5/version:
  - `0e973bd4`: project/core/CLI versions are aligned to `4.25.2`; local `changelogs/v4.25.2.md` documents only the features actually absorbed in this fork.
  - `e26fe1c3f`: Markdown-aware knowledge-base chunking was absorbed with a local `MarkdownChunker`, `.md/.markdown/.mkd/.mdx` upload selection in `KBHelper`, and focused tests for heading context and fenced-code heading avoidance.
  - `0ffdf544`: default LLM context-compression prompts now emphasize seamless continuation and list useful read materials/files for future work.
  - `b8cf2ef`: ChatUI recording now returns a `File` from `useRecording` and stages it through the common upload path so record previews, clearing, and attachment send behavior are consistent with other files.
- 2026-06-05 context/LTM compatibility rewrite:
  - `95d80578`/`df6eef052`/`d2f555151`: upstream group-chat LTM was absorbed as local `GroupChatContext`. It keeps one in-memory group-record buffer, ignores wake commands when recording, supports active-reply gating, and now exposes only the structured prompt-extension surface. It does not replace or write to `astrbot/core/memory/*`.
  - `1daa0e336`: upstream context compression improvements were absorbed into the runner-level context manager. LLM compression now splits by logical rounds, keeps recent exact context by token ratio, always preserves the active user round, appends a continuation-oriented summary instruction, and sanitizes the compression payload by the compression provider's modalities.
  - Local policy intentionally preserved: `modalities=[]` remains text-only in this fork. The upstream empty-list-as-unconfigured behavior was not imported.
  - Compatibility note: old `llm_compress_keep_recent` was initially accepted; local configuration cleanup removed it on 2026-09-24, leaving `llm_compress_keep_recent_ratio` as the sole control.
  - `465a685b`: FIRST_NOTICE files include the EULA hint, and `FIRST_NOTICE.ru-RU.md` is present.
- 2026-06-07 v4.25.3/v4.25.4 small stability and compatibility batches:
  - `7e22a07e0`: `/name` and UMO alias support were rewritten locally with a dedicated `umo_aliases` DB model, backup coverage, dashboard API exposure, and local UI display integration that preserves raw UMO values for operations/copy behavior.
  - `ef53a933e`: DingTalk stream reconnect was rewritten with bounded exponential backoff, termination wake-up, and cancellation of the running SDK start future.
  - `fde0ea923`/`6ae103a24`: project/core/CLI versioning reached `4.25.3`, `changelogs/v4.25.3.md` was added, and Dashboard login fields gained credential autocomplete hints.
  - `556903c1`: `EventBus` now keeps strong references to active pipeline tasks until completion and logs uncaught task exceptions.
  - `c7e9d5b4`: WebChat web-search citation instructions are appended once during main-agent request construction instead of repeatedly from `on_tool_end`, preserving local prompt pipeline behavior and avoiding repeated system-message mutation.
  - `66a10c08`: personal WeChat API timeout defaults were raised from 15 seconds to 120 seconds.
  - `1a0499878`: Anthropic usage extraction accepts `usage=None` for content-filtered responses and returns zero usage instead of raising.
  - `c4251e82`: project/core/CLI versions are aligned to `4.25.4`, with local changelog text reflecting only the absorbed local changes.
  - `0db7fc9b`: dashboard `pnpm-lock.yaml` overrides were already present locally and needed no code change.
  - Resolved on 2026-06-12: plugin page theme sync (`65fe0574`) and plugin WebUI sidebar entries (`c58916b8`) were rewritten locally; upstream SQLAlchemy/provider-stats revert commits (`c70a1924`, `bdc32bb7`) were not imported because this fork keeps the local SQLite `NullPool`/PRAGMA and provider-stats retry strategy.
- 2026-06-11 v4.25.5 small/remaining batch:
  - `8f5178d26`: Star Context typing restored locally with `TYPE_CHECKING` import of `Context`, preserving runtime import behavior.
  - `4b562689e`: core shutdown now disposes the main DB engine after task settlement and memory/postprocessor shutdown.
  - `0fb3f5eb9`: datetime system reminders now include a locale-independent English weekday field, with focused unit coverage.
  - `bec0de2e2`: FAISS implementation no longer imports the FAISS C library at package/module import time; loading is deferred to `EmbeddingStorage` construction.
  - `56d2b3fb5`: folder creation dialog submits on Enter and disables the form while creating.
  - `fb8f4d68e`: backup directory coverage now includes Skills, and Dashboard backup/import copy reflects the new scope.
  - `af70151ff`: core/CLI/package versions are aligned to `4.25.5`; local changelog text documents the subset actually absorbed in this fork.
  - `66ec415e5`: `send_message_to_user` now restricts arbitrary local host file paths for non-admin local-runtime calls while preserving workspace/temp/system-tmp paths and existing admin/unrestricted behavior.
  - `05c137eb2`: QQ Official Webhook signature verification and lazy restart-safe `BotHttp` setup were rewritten locally, preserving this fork's extra-data cache and dedup behavior.
  - `a3c25ec2c`: plugin reinstall/update matching now prefers repository source identity and only falls back to names for installed plugins without repo metadata.
  - `32cfcbf52`: `GroupChatContext` now includes quoted reply content in formatted group context while preserving the local Yakumo prompt-extension collector path.
  - `ae44b912f`: per-tool permission management was absorbed with a local execution-entry guard, dashboard permission API, ToolTable permission controls, and focused tests. Builtin tools remain read-only and keep their own hardcoded permission checks.
  - `0b2234936`: ElevenLabs TTS API provider was added with provider-manager registration, default config template, WebUI metadata, format validation, voice-settings handling, and offline unit coverage.
  - Low-priority upstream chores were absorbed where relevant: LM Studio Docker wording typo (`60dfd565a`), Codecov action v7 (`b321499e0`), and pyupgrade cleanup for `shlex.join` / `AsyncGenerator[None]` (`eeabdb982`). `astrbot/utils/__init__.py` was already empty locally.
- 2026-06-12 SQLAlchemy/provider-stats, WebUI thread, docs/chore, and plugin page/sidebar rewrite:
  - `c70a1924` was reviewed as a revert of upstream SQLAlchemy compatibility work. Local code intentionally keeps `NullPool`, connection PRAGMAs, document-storage safeguards, and adds explicit SQLite `busy_timeout=30000` / driver timeout coverage instead of reverting the local DB hardening.
  - `bdc32bb7` was reviewed as a revert of provider-stats SQLite lock retry. Local code intentionally keeps bounded retry for transient SQLite lock errors and preserves `CancelledError` propagation; tests cover retry, exhaustion, non-lock `OperationalError`, and cancellation.
  - `36d6f3b` WebUI inline edit/regenerate/thread flow was absorbed through local compatibility gaps rather than importing the broad upstream history rewrite: saved message events now carry saved `refs`, the thread input uses the shared IME Enter guard, and thread unified origins stay isolated from the parent WebChat session.
  - Docs/test/chore items were selectively absorbed: FAQ hard-refresh guidance (`7ff58f29`), QQ Official WebSocket typo (`000d638c`), random initial password/source-deploy copy, Matrix docs cleanup, and function-calling/code-interpreter/PPIO tool-management wording now match the local WebUI-driven tool flow. Upstream test-only churn (`48e111e4`) remains skipped.
  - `65fe0574` plugin page theme sync was rewritten locally: plugin page content, bridge SDK context, asset URLs, and iframe postMessage context all carry light/dark theme state without weakening plugin-page auth/token handling.
  - `c58916b8` plugin WebUI sidebar entries were rewritten locally: plugin metadata supports `icon`, plugin APIs expose it, the sidebar adds a localized plugin-pages group before More, and plugin icons are limited to local `mdi-*` names instead of remote SVG injection.
  - Validation: targeted pytest for dashboard/plugin/thread/provider-stats/SQLite/document-storage paths passed, focused ruff passed, dashboard `vue-tsc --noEmit` passed, changed i18n JSON parsed after BOM stripping, and `git diff --check` reported only Windows CRLF warnings.

### Topic Reference Intake Plan

Use this table as the live working plan. Update `Status`, `Local action`, and `Next check` whenever an upstream topic is studied. It tracks reference intake decisions, not pending history synchronization.

| Topic | Status | Upstream examples | Local action | Next check |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Security fixes | In progress | Upload path traversal, backup importer traversal, password policy, updater zip root path, T2I SSTI validation | Upload filename sanitization, backup-importer handling, updater zip-root handling, T2I template validation, and the coordinated dashboard PBKDF2/setup migration are present. | Continue treating security changes as coordinated backend/WebUI migrations when protocol or storage contracts change. |
| Provider and model runtime | In progress | OpenAI http client, reasoning content, Claude no-arg tools, MiniMax TTS, Embedding providers, Anthropic compatibility, provider-stats SQLite locks | Several small compatibility fixes were rewritten locally. This batch keeps the local provider-stats retry path and adds SQLite busy-timeout coverage instead of importing upstream revert commits. | After commit, re-run `git cherry` triage and review provider warning/default-model edge cases only if behavior differs locally. |
| Platform adapters and outbound media | Mostly absorbed | Active reply images, Weixin OC send failures/session timeout, Telegram media group errors, Discord startup quota, KOOK role mentions, QQ Official markdown/send fixes, Dingtalk/Feishu QR setup | Active reply image, SILK, Weixin OC send failure/session timeout, Telegram media group logging, Discord command-sync quota handling, QQ Official markdown/active-push fixes, KOOK role mentions, message-tool path handling, and Dingtalk/Lark/Weixin OC one-click QR registration were absorbed. | Re-check only when new upstream platform adapter commits appear; remaining platform `git cherry` positives in this snapshot are rewrite-equivalent. |
| Dashboard UX and WebUI | Mostly absorbed | IME Enter, console layout, provider config UI, inline edit/regenerate, plugin UI, Noto Sans Cyrillic support, initial password UX, stale `data/dist` fallback | IME, console, upload sanitization, provider test feedback, provider config panel/model-add flow, T2I template error feedback, Baidu search-key visibility, bundled dashboard fallback for stale `data/dist`, Noto Sans Cyrillic font stack, always-visible outlined action buttons, setup-page initial password UX, and local inline/thread compatibility gaps were absorbed. | Keep larger plugin/dashboard rewrites separate; do not import broad upstream history rewrites unless the local checkpoint/prompt semantics are explicitly redesigned. |
| Plugin system | Mostly absorbed | Plugin pages, plugin i18n, plugin changelogs/update system, plugin storage downloads, install cleanup, plugin-page theme/sidebar | Dynamic plugin Web API routing, plugin page i18n bridge/context, plugin changelog/readme surfaces, update download URLs, `pages`/`icon` metadata, plugin page theme propagation, sidebar plugin page entries, and install cleanup are absorbed. | Re-check only if later upstream adds new plugin runtime surfaces beyond the current page/API/update/sidebar paths. |
| Knowledge base and retrieval | Mostly absorbed | FTS5 sparse retrieval, EPUB upload, blank-prompt KB retrieval skip, RST/ADOC upload, Firecrawl search tools, KB CRUD contract/pagination | FTS5 sparse retrieval with BM25 fallback, EPUB parser/upload/read support, RST/ADOC upload support, blank-prompt KB retrieval skip, Firecrawl config/tool hook, and local Quart KB CRUD/list pagination contract are absorbed. | Re-check only if later upstream changes retrieval ranking/storage semantics, adds new document formats, or changes KB API behavior beyond the local Quart contract. |
| Computer use / sandbox | Mostly absorbed | Shipyard profile selection, readiness gate, idle sandbox expiry, CUA native upload, sandbox image download delivery | CUA runtime, native file upload/write fallback, idle timeout cleanup, WebUI idle-timeout config, explicit/auto Shipyard Neo profile behavior, readiness gate, stale sandbox cleanup, and sandbox image download delivery are absorbed. | Re-check only if later upstream changes sandbox lifecycle, capability contracts, or CUA SDK compatibility. |
| Auth, CLI, deployment, update | Mostly absorbed | Initial dashboard password env var, legacy password messages, update progress dialog, deploy scripts, Dingtalk/Lark/Weixin OC QR registration | Platform QR registration (Dingtalk/Lark/Weixin OC), update progress tracking/dialog, PBKDF2 dashboard password storage/setup flow, core and CLI initial password env support, `astrbot password`, and the final docs-public install scripts were absorbed. | Re-check only if later upstream changes install/update operational contracts. |
| Docs, version bumps, dependency chores | Mostly absorbed | Version bumps, README/docs URL updates, pnpm action bumps, release instructions, FAQ/deploy/tool docs corrections | User-approved release-maintenance passes aligned versions/changelogs through the current fork version, refreshed README badge/contributor URLs where still stale, bumped pnpm/docker GitHub Actions, updated source-deploy docs for generated initial passwords, and selectively absorbed FAQ/deploy/tool docs corrections that affect this fork's current behavior. | Keep broad docs translations and process-only docs separate unless the user asks for another docs sweep. |

### Review Rules for Future Upstream Sync

- Always update this `Reference Intake Board` before and after a sync batch.
- Record the exact upstream ref used. If fetch fails, record that and use the latest local snapshot explicitly.
- Prefer small topic batches over broad merges.
- Mark each upstream topic as `Absorbed`, `Deferred`, `Skipped`, or `Needs review`.
- For rewritten merges, record the local commit hash and the upstream commit or PR that inspired it.
- Do not treat `git cherry` as authoritative for this fork; use it only as a triage aid.
- Keep local prompt, memory, postprocess, and interaction architecture as the default source of truth unless an upstream change is explicitly chosen to replace it.

## 2026-05-24 Upstream Snapshot Refresh

Reviewed upstream delta: `dceacd5a..ff28eca9c`.

Remote status:

- HTTPS `git fetch upstream --prune` failed during this review due GitHub connection timeout.
- HTTPS `git ls-remote upstream refs/heads/master` also failed due GitHub connection timeout.
- SSH `git ls-remote git@github.com:AstrBotDevs/AstrBot.git refs/heads/master` succeeded and confirmed `ff28eca9c`.
- `upstream/master` was refreshed from `git@github.com:AstrBotDevs/AstrBot.git` and remained at `ff28eca9c`.

Updated triage counts:

- Git-only divergence: local-only `286`, upstream-only `194`.
- `git cherry -v master upstream/master`: `67` patch-equivalent absorbed, `127` still shown as unabsorbed.
- Interpretation remains unchanged: `+` entries may still be functionally absorbed by local rewrites, so topic review is required before merging or rewriting.

Phase-B sync strategy:

- First planned pseudo-merge boundary: `67c7445d` (`v4.23.6`).
- Rationale: this boundary already has a dedicated 2026-04-27 review, and the remaining `git cherry` positives before it are now classified below.
- Do not pseudo-merge newer upstream history until each later boundary receives the same explicit classification.

### Phase B Boundary: `67c7445d` / `v4.23.6`

Remaining `git cherry +` entries up to this boundary were reviewed for whether a staged `git merge -s ours 67c7445d` would hide unprocessed work.

| Upstream commit | Topic | Phase-B status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1199b704` | KOOK role mentions | Absorbed | Confirmed in local KOOK adapter, role cache, data models, and tests. |
| `ba1e2223` | Video attachment handling for LLM | Absorbed | Direct and quoted video attachments are already appended as text references. |
| `e6b68e9b` | FileReadTool description and modality checking | Absorbed | Local file-read/tool-result modality handling already covers image/PDF/docx-style outputs. |
| `36d6f3b` | WebUI inline edit/regenerate/thread flow | Absorbed/Local rewrite | Local ChatUI already has edited/regenerate/checkpoint paths. The 2026-06-12 pass absorbed compatible gaps only: saved `refs` propagation, thread IME Enter guard, and isolated thread unified origins; the broad upstream DB/history rewrite was not imported. |

### Phase B Boundary: `afe99955` / `v4.24.0`

Remaining `git cherry +` entries from `v4.23.6` through this boundary were reviewed before considering a staged `git merge -s ours afe99955`.

| Upstream commit | Topic | Phase-B status | Notes |

| `cb5c172e` | CUA computer-use sandbox | Absorbed | Local CUA booter, config metadata, GUI tools, sandbox routing, and unit tests are already present. |
| `e218620a` | One-line deploy script | Absorbed | Final install script assets were absorbed as docs-public install helpers without importing the broad startup/config churn from the initial upstream patch. |
| `e4a9274b` | Deploy script path/gitignore fix | Absorbed | Covered by adding the final `docs/public/install.ps1` and `docs/public/install.sh` paths. |
| `9016a3b2` | pnpm action bump | Absorbed/Superseded | Superseded by the user-approved pnpm/action-setup `v6.0.7` alignment pass. |
| `4d9340c` | Windows/Linux deploy scripts | Absorbed | Added final Windows/Linux docs-public install scripts. |
| `1801834` | Remove BOM from install script | Absorbed | Absorbed by using the final upstream `install.ps1` content after the BOM removal. |
| `d8de0035` | Attachment saved events in WebChat/LiveChat | Absorbed | Rewritten locally in `chat.py` and `live_chat.py`; generated image/record/file/video attachments now emit `attachment_saved` with attachment ID/type before final message save. |
| `6b36e1ab` | Comment out `tool_choice="required"` in skills-like re-query | Skipped | Upstream appears to be a temporary provider-debug compatibility change. Local skills-like re-query intentionally keeps `required` semantics and has tests for the re-query path. |
| `eb69bf36` | Shipyard Neo readiness gate and cleanup | Absorbed | Local Shipyard Neo booter waits for ready status, deletes failed/timed-out sandboxes, and shuts down stale Neo sandboxes with `delete_sandbox=True`; tests cover these paths. |
| `587286a9` | Warn when default chat provider is unset | Absorbed | Already present locally in core lifecycle provider initialization. |
| `7c185f8e` | Plugin detail page | Absorbed | Local extension page includes `PluginDetailPage` and installed/market detail navigation. |

| `d72cb78f` | Plugin pinning | Absorbed | Local extension preference storage and installed plugin tab pin/unpin ordering are present. |
| `2e49eb84` | Plugin internationalization | Absorbed | Plugin metadata includes i18n, dashboard config route exposes plugin i18n, and WebUI resolves localized plugin text. |
| `6f839173` | Plugin detail/install i18n experience | Absorbed | Local market/install/detail flow carries plugin i18n, pages, components, and localized display fields. |
| `a2335010` | Metrics batching/perf | Absorbed | Local metrics already batches counters, uploads asynchronously, stores platform stats, and supports config/env disabling. |
| `ac5cb9b5` | Official plugin storage downloads | Absorbed | Local plugin install/update routes pass `download_url`, updater supports archive downloads, and WebUI selects official storage URLs. |
| `bc1e7c95` | Plugin short description | Absorbed | Local plugin metadata/search/i18n handling includes short-description support. |
| `aa0b7a2c` | Fallback max context tokens | Absorbed | Already present locally in default config, metadata i18n, and main-agent build path. |
| `1f9c2c2b` | Anthropic custom headers/system prompt compatibility | Absorbed | Already present locally. |
| `750597d` | Provider model-add flow | Absorbed | Rewritten locally by wiring available-model clicks to the model config dialog before save. |

| `dee4f14a` | Ruff format | Skipped | Formatting-only upstream churn. |
| `f2370cd1` | Plugins can add skills | Absorbed | Local `SkillManager` discovers plugin `skills/`, plugin changes sync skills to active sandboxes, and plugin components expose skill entries. |
| `6eb8a51` | System prompt guide docs | Skipped | Upstream docs-only guide; not required for current Yakumo runtime sync. |
| `fff9c8ee` | Plugin custom pages WebUI | Absorbed | Local plugin page bridge/auth/routes, page component serialization, docs, and `PluginPagePage` are present. |
| `afe99955` | Version bump to `4.24.0` | Absorbed/Superseded | Superseded by the user-approved `4.25.1` version alignment pass. |

New upstream commits since previous ledger baseline:

| Upstream commit | Topic | Initial status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `2d786268` | SQLAlchemy compatibility on macOS | Absorbed | Rewritten locally with SQLite `NullPool`, connect-time PRAGMAs, SQLModel document table creation via compiled SQLite DDL, and a guarded unique `documents.doc_id` index migration. |
| `7ff58f29` | FAQ hard-refresh note | Absorbed | Added local FAQ guidance for hard refresh after deleting stale `data/dist`, alongside the local random-initial-password/PBKDF2 guidance. |
| `000d638c` | QQ Official WebSocket docs typo | Absorbed | Fixed the Chinese QQ Official WebSocket typo. |
| `bc35daa1` | Restore mobile provider-source deletion | Absorbed | Rewritten locally in the customized provider-source panel; mobile layout now exposes a selected-source delete button and delete actions have accessible labels/titles. |
| `284c4082` | GitHub Actions dependency bump | Absorbed | User requested dependency/version maintenance; docker setup-buildx/login/build-push actions were bumped to upstream versions. |
| `ae44163b` | Smooth markdown streaming | Absorbed | Rewritten locally by threading existing message streaming state into `MarkdownRender` and upgrading `markstream-vue`/`stream-markdown` through `pnpm install --lockfile-only`. |
| `23d70dbd` | Plugin card direct access and embedded page height | Absorbed | Rewritten locally: plugin list exposes lightweight `pages` names only, card opens the first Plugin Page directly, and embedded page/state height uses the upstream smaller viewport offset. Full page components remain detail-only. |
| `538772c3` | Xiaomi and Xiaomi Token Plan LLM providers | Absorbed | Rewritten locally as two explicit provider adapters: OpenAI-compatible Xiaomi uses the OpenAI prompt renderer and MiMo endpoint/model fallback; Xiaomi Token Plan uses the Anthropic prompt renderer, fixed Token Plan endpoint, and Bearer authorization header. Default config templates, provider manager dynamic imports, WebUI icons, and focused tests were added. |
| `89153fdf` | MiMo reasoning content compatibility | Absorbed | Rewritten locally in the OpenAI-compatible provider: assistant messages with `reasoning_content` are preserved by sanitization, and MiMo reasoning models receive empty `reasoning_content` on assistant history when missing. |
| `465a685b` | EULA hint for first notification | Skipped | Product/legal first-notification UX; not part of this fork's current runtime sync. |
| `85f9c4df` | MiMo voice-design TTS payload | Absorbed | Rewritten locally; `voicedesign` TTS models omit unsupported `audio.voice`, while regular TTS models still include it. |
| `7f94bce3` | QQ Official split message chain by media | Absorbed | Rewritten locally with `MessageChain.derive()` so split media chunks preserve `use_markdown_`, `use_t2i_`, and chain type; event sends and proactive `send_by_session` now send at most one media component per QQ Official API call. |
| `a221c74b` | Plugin metadata repo type guard | Absorbed | Rewritten locally by serializing plugin `repo` as a string in plugin list and detail responses. |
| `26e867cc` | Image requests route to vision fallback | Absorbed | Rewritten locally in `build_main_agent`: image requests switch to the first configured fallback chat provider that explicitly supports `image`, preserving the local prompt pipeline and existing modality downgrade fallback. |
| `5bbcdced` | Skip empty LLM summaries | Absorbed | Rewritten locally in `LLMSummaryCompressor`; empty or whitespace-only summaries now keep original history and log a warning. |
| `de0a7afd` | pnpm action bump | Absorbed/Superseded | Superseded by the user-approved pnpm/action-setup `v6.0.7` alignment pass. |
| `7a9fb33d` | FAQ typo | Skipped | Docs-only upstream typo fix. |
| `c4693fa6` | RST/ADOC knowledge uploads | Absorbed | Rewritten locally as a narrow upload/parser whitelist update using existing `MarkitdownParser`, with WebUI accept/i18n/icon hints. |
| `a38e9881`/`35245519` | FTS5 sparse knowledge retrieval | Absorbed | Present locally in `DocumentStorage` and `SparseRetriever`: contentless FTS5 index creation/rebuild/search is used when available, with in-memory BM25 fallback when FTS5 is unavailable. Unit coverage exists in `tests/unit/test_document_storage_fts.py` and `tests/unit/test_sparse_retriever.py`. |
| `c2aeeac4`/`d9ab3534` | Legacy `documents_fts` recovery | Absorbed | Present locally; startup validates the `documents_fts` virtual table, recreates invalid legacy non-FTS tables, and tests cover recovery. |
| `e852e906`/`76ee4f27` | EPUB knowledge upload support | Absorbed | Present locally via `EpubParser`, parser selection for `.epub`, dashboard upload accept/i18n, file-read EPUB support, and parser/file-read tests. |
| `16593354` | Automated MDI subset generation | Absorbed | Rewritten locally; dashboard dev/build scripts now generate the MDI subset before Vite, and generated subset assets are ignored instead of tracked. |
| `d15606d2` | Dashboard password CLI command | Absorbed | Rewritten locally for the coordinated PBKDF2 migration: `astrbot password` validates password strength, writes `dashboard.pbkdf2_password` plus legacy `dashboard.password`, clears the change-required flag, and can optionally update the dashboard username. |
| `0e6ad1c` | CLI initial dashboard password env | Absorbed | Rewritten locally for the PBKDF2 migration: `astrbot init` creates `data/cmd_config.json` from defaults with `ASTRBOT_DASHBOARD_INITIAL_PASSWORD` written to PBKDF2 and legacy hash fields, marks storage upgraded, requires first login password change, and does not overwrite an existing config. |
| `93428a79` | Core initial dashboard password env | Absorbed | Core config initialization now resolves `ASTRBOT_DASHBOARD_INITIAL_PASSWORD` when generating first-use dashboard credentials, validates the password policy, and otherwise generates a random compliant password. |
| `7ddf6371` | Dashboard password policy/PBKDF2 setup flow | Absorbed | Rewritten locally as a coordinated backend/WebUI migration: plaintext login verifies PBKDF2 or legacy MD5 storage, MD5 hash strings no longer authenticate directly, legacy configs can log in with the real password and must set a new password to upgrade, setup-status/setup routes are exposed, stat hints include legacy/upgrade state, and the login WebUI now sends plaintext. |
| `e05dd650` | Legacy password login guidance | Absorbed | The local login failure mode now matches the PBKDF2 migration boundary: legacy MD5 storage requires the real plaintext password, not the stored hash, and tests cover the failed-hash-login path plus upgrade. FAQ copy was not copied because local docs are maintained separately. |
| `3290d755` | Prefer bundled dashboard over stale `data/dist` | Absorbed | Rewritten locally; version comparison now selects bundled WebUI when an older user `data/dist` would otherwise shadow it. |
| `587286a9` | Warn when default chat provider is unset or invalid | Absorbed | Already present locally before this batch; lifecycle resets the warning guard after provider reload and warns on missing/invalid default provider ID. |
| `bc2c67d4` | Dynamic plugin Web API routes | Absorbed | Already present locally; `/api/plug/<path>` uses Werkzeug route matching so plugin APIs can expose dynamic path params while preserving method checks. |
| `319f50be` | Plugin changelogs and update download URLs | Absorbed | Already present locally; plugin routes expose changelog reads, update/install paths pass `download_url`, batch update supports per-plugin download URLs, and the WebUI has changelog/update flows. |
| `cb4f941e` | Plugin page internationalization | Absorbed | Already present locally; Plugin Page bridge receives signed initial context with locale/i18n, page serialization includes `i18n_key`, and frontend plugin i18n utilities resolve page metadata. |
| `1a030634`/`b3381c64` | Noto Sans Cyrillic WebUI font stack | Absorbed | Rewritten locally with Noto Sans loaded from Google Fonts, global body stack set to Outfit/Noto Sans before CJK fallbacks, and `.Outfit` sharing that stack. |
| `f9cbe790` | Always show outlined action buttons | Absorbed | Rewritten locally by removing default hidden opacity from `OutlinedActionListItem` hover actions. |
| `5be6536f` | SOCKS proxy updater support | Absorbed | Already present locally; updater requests use `httpx.AsyncClient(trust_env=True)` and cleanup partial downloads on failure. |
| `43989471` | Normalize malformed MCP required flags | Absorbed | Already present locally in `_normalize_mcp_input_schema` with unit coverage. |
| `662b1d36` | `RegexFilter` accepts compiled patterns | Absorbed | Already present locally; `regex_str` is derived from the compiled pattern. |
| `29a449f9` | `rate_limit_count=0` guard | Absorbed | Already present locally; rate-limit loop exits when count is non-positive. |
| `47f78be3` | Cron local/timezone display fix | Absorbed | Already present locally; cron next-run and route serialization attach UTC timezone information. |
| `b2a95713` | Bocha brotli workaround | Absorbed | Already present locally; Bocha requests set `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`. |
| `00ebebb1` | QQ Official transient retry expansion | Absorbed | Already present locally; retries include `OSError` and `asyncio.TimeoutError` with five attempts. |
| `2f479b52` | Missing platform adapter filter types | Absorbed | Already present locally; newer adapter names are mapped and `ALL` short-circuits. |
| `e8d3e183` | Disable metrics config | Absorbed | Already present locally in default config, config metadata i18n, and `Metric._is_disabled()`. |
| `ba1e2223` | Video attachment handling for LLM | Absorbed | Already present locally; direct and quoted video attachments are appended as text references. |
| `bbda1e67` | Downscale oversized images | Absorbed | Already present locally; images exceeding max edge compress even when file size is below threshold. |
| `433836d9` | Guard `None` system prompts | Absorbed | Already present locally before persona/skills prompt append paths. |
| `5d79c999` | WeCom duplicate text message suppression | Absorbed | Already present locally with a 15-second per-session text dedup cache. |
| `e6b68e9b` | File-read/modality handling | Absorbed | Already present locally; file read description and modality sanitization are implemented in the runner/provider utility path. |
| `094aef62` | Preserve decorator kwargs in register helpers | Absorbed | Already present locally for platform adapter type, regex, and permission decorators. |
| `0711172f` | Stale command hints | Absorbed | Removed stale slash-command hints in active-reply/T2I/tool-call warning paths and points users to WebUI instead. |
| `3f20bbdf` | T2I Shiki issue | Absorbed | Rewritten locally; Shiki runtime template preparation now runs in the executor to avoid blocking the event loop. |
| `1e48bab5` | Streaming `delta=None` handling | Absorbed | Rewritten locally in OpenAI streaming path; skips `delta=None` state updates and guards final completion extraction. |
| `f5bd4f30` | Preserve original `completion_text` in skills-like tool re-query | Absorbed | Rewritten locally; second-stage skills-like re-query now updates tool-call fields without replacing already-visible assistant text. |
| `fd4fe843` | Docs fix | Skipped | Docs-only unless it affects local Yakumo docs. |
| `dcc99e6b` | ChatUI command suggestions | Absorbed | Rewritten locally against the customized ChatUI; slash-command suggestions load from `/api/commands`, composer focus is restored after chat actions, and provider-selection failures now send a visible LLM error message. |
| `ff28eca9` | OpenAI streaming usage preservation | Absorbed | Rewritten locally; final usage chunks with `choices=[]` are still passed to stream state. |
| `5745ce5b`/`24bb25c6` | CUA native file upload interfaces | Absorbed | Present locally; `CuaBooter.upload_file` prefers sandbox/native `upload_file`, then `files.upload`, then `files.write_bytes`, with POSIX shell/base64 fallback only when native APIs are unavailable. Tests cover native upload, write-bytes fallback, native failure propagation, shell quoting, and non-POSIX rejection. |
| `49cd4d2a`/`5115f112` | CUA idle sandbox expiry | Absorbed | Present locally; `computer_client` tracks per-session CUA idle state, refreshes expiry on reuse, shuts down idle CUA sandboxes proactively, and leaves non-CUA booters unscheduled. |
| `f02845eb`/`3036a3f1` | CUA idle timeout config exposure | Absorbed | Present locally; `cua_idle_timeout` is the dashboard-exposed CUA lifecycle knob, while `cua_ttl` remains hidden from configurable metadata. |
| `1b09132e`/`a1e4240d` | Shipyard Neo profile selection | Absorbed | Present locally; a non-empty configured profile is honored exactly, while an empty profile auto-selects the best available Bay profile and falls back to `python-default`. |
| `eb69bf36`/`f9644946` | Shipyard Neo readiness gate and cleanup | Absorbed | Present locally; `ShipyardNeoBooter` waits for ready status, deletes failed/expired/timed-out sandboxes, closes clients on shutdown, and stale Neo booters are evicted with `delete_sandbox=True`. |
| `3a1d6c8f` | `None` tool-call arguments | Absorbed | Present locally in the OpenAI-compatible completion parser and tool-loop runner; `None` arguments from providers are normalized to `{}` for no-parameter tools. |
| `a09657e6` | MiniMax TTS timber-weight parsing | Absorbed | Present locally; empty or invalid `minimax-timber-weight` config falls back to a default timber-weight payload instead of crashing JSON parsing. |
| `871b9327` | Tencent SILK magic-byte detection | Absorbed | Present locally; audio magic detection recognizes both standard `#!SILK_V3` and Tencent `\x02#!SILK_V3`, and `ensure_wav` routes SILK through the Tencent converter. |
| `22ba831a` | Send-message missing path guard | Absorbed | Present locally; missing local/sandbox media paths return an error before constructing/sending message components, with component-specific path error text. |
| `1d696264` | Active reply image passthrough | Absorbed | Present locally; active reply calls collect image components from the triggering message and pass them through `event.request_llm(..., image_urls=...)`. |
| `d1059cd5` | Windows updater zip root normalization | Absorbed | Present locally; updater zip extraction normalizes archive roots and test coverage exercises Windows-style archive-root behavior. |
| `116c66b5` | Blank-prompt KB retrieval skip | Absorbed | Present locally; main-agent build skips KB retrieval when prompt text is blank and no image inputs are present. |
| `041c35c3` | Plugin install temp cleanup and failed-tracking guard | Absorbed | Present locally; repeated file installs that conflict with an existing plugin skip failed-plugin tracking and remove temporary `plugin_upload_*` directories. Current plugin install flow tests remain focused on dependency install behavior. |
| `7d402fa1` | NVIDIA and Ollama embedding providers | Absorbed | Rewritten locally before this pass; `nvidia_embedding_source.py` and `ollama_embedding_source.py` are registered in provider manager, exposed in default config templates, and NVIDIA embedding has `input_type` metadata. |
| `010e6d2e`/`39386eeb`/`989cc0d6`/`c4810804`/`c77cb0f4`/`02291a32`/`d609f23b` | Version bumps and changelogs | Absorbed | User requested version/changelog maintenance; CLI/package/core versions are aligned to `4.25.1`, and release changelogs `v4.24.3`, `v4.24.5`, `v4.25.0`, and `v4.25.1` were added. |
| `4bcaaab4`/`1d3f54ca` | GitHub Actions dependency bumps | Absorbed | User requested dependency maintenance; pnpm/action-setup was bumped to `v6.0.7` in docs/dashboard/release workflows. |
| `9165278d`/`77fa0e46` | README contributor/Trendshift image updates | Absorbed | User requested README maintenance; stale localized README contributor/Trendshift badges were updated to the upstream values. English README was already current. |
| `942dcdfc`/`bd9aade8`/`cb90de75`/`ef73d2da` | General upstream docs corrections | Absorbed selectively | Docs that affect current fork behavior were updated: function-calling/code-interpreter/PPIO now point to WebUI tool management, Matrix docs were cleaned up, and deploy/WebUI password docs now describe generated credentials. Broad upstream-only doc cleanup remains out of scope. |
| `48e111e4` | Remove upstream-only test | Skipped | Test-churn only; no local runtime behavior to absorb. |
| `37d61592`/`7d72e3a9`/`2d6f5e64`/`4672a04e` | Random initial password docs/messages | Absorbed | Runtime behavior and WebUI startup/setup messaging were absorbed through random generated first-use credentials and setup flow; source-deploy docs now point users to console-generated credentials and `ASTRBOT_DASHBOARD_INITIAL_PASSWORD` instead of fixed defaults. |
| `8b16e4d6` | File component filename sanitization | Absorbed | Rewritten locally in `File._download_file`; remote names are reduced to a safe basename, dangerous characters/NULs are replaced or removed, and downloads stay under AstrBot temp storage. |
| `9688a64c` | Plugin detail sub-command count label | Absorbed | Rewritten locally in the extension detail i18n files for English, Chinese, and Russian. |
| `e960c149` | Duplicate plugin display guard | Absorbed/No-op | Local plugin list code did not contain the duplicate append path, so the upstream fix is already functionally satisfied. |
| `022a5dd9` | Avoid duplicate quoted-image captioning | Absorbed | Rewritten locally so quoted images are not captioned when the main provider supports image input, and the main provider is not used as an implicit caption fallback when no caption provider is configured. |
| `9bd38cad` | Trim segmented reply text | Absorbed | Rewritten locally in result decoration so split plain segments are stripped before being appended. |
| `e087b9de` | Marketplace/local plugin name matching | Absorbed | Rewritten locally by exposing `marketplace_name` from plugin APIs and matching extension market entries by normalized repo or marketplace name with local-name fallback. |
| `adae1f359` | Command suggestion wake words and hover info | Absorbed | Rewritten locally against the customized chat input: `/api/commands` returns per-config `wake_prefix`, suggestions trigger/display with configured prefixes, and command descriptions are shown in a hover tooltip. |

Simple batch review:

- `7a519d4d` (`websearch_firecrawl_key`) was already absorbed before this batch; `provider_settings.websearch_firecrawl_key` exists in `DEFAULT_CONFIG`.
- `22ba831a` (`send_message_to_user` missing local/sandbox path handling) was already absorbed before this batch; missing paths stop message construction before send.
- `720d384b` (console auto-scroll ref synchronization) was already absorbed before this batch; `ConsolePage` initializes `ConsoleDisplayer.autoScroll` on mount and keeps it synced.

Medium batch rewrite:

- `dcc99e6b` (ChatUI command suggestions) absorbed by adding a local `CommandSuggestion` composer panel, preserving the customized chat layout and adding visible provider-selection error replies.
- `37142fd2` (update progress tracking) absorbed by threading download progress callbacks through core/WebUI downloads, adding `/api/update/progress`, and showing per-stage progress inside the existing update dialog.
- `16593354` (automated MDI subset generation) absorbed by running the subset generator in dashboard dev/build scripts and removing generated subset assets from version control.

Simple follow-up review:

- `fbe9a38c`/`fd2ca702` (dark-mode code blocks inside list items) were already present locally in `ThemeAwareMarkdownCodeBlock`.
- `dd716e61` (thinking/response separator) was already present locally in result decoration.
- `c9182c27` (console log level alignment and mobile layout) was already present locally in `ConsoleDisplayer`.
- `224915fb` (plugin publishing 16MB size limit docs) was already present locally in English and Chinese docs.
- `f86de988` (Discord command-sync daily quota handling) was already present locally in the Discord adapter.
- `0830f48a`/`718449d6` path-conflict self-healing and GitHub dashboard fallback download behavior were already present locally.
- `35f5d7e` (AMR audio quality and opus conversion simplification) was absorbed by routing opus conversion through `convert_audio_format` and adding AMR ffmpeg filters.
- `f6a99a25` (SiliconFlow knowledge-base API key wording) was absorbed as a docs-only correction.
- README-only Trendshift/contributor image updates remain skipped for this fork because they only affect upstream repository presentation.

Platform adapter review:

- Reviewed upstream platform-related commits still shown as `git cherry` positives against `ff28eca9c`: `1199b704` (KOOK role mentions), `b711425b` (QQ Official message-level Markdown control), `f86de988` (Discord command-sync quota), `094c2de8` (Weixin OC media send failures), `6982ef7d` (Weixin OC session timeout), `aace90da`/`c88025c2`/`a1e95081` (Lark/Dingtalk/Weixin OC QR registration and random ID suffix).
- `1199b704` is functionally absorbed locally. KOOK has role cache support, `(rol)` parsing, role-update system-event cache invalidation, `user/me` and `user/view` response models, and matching `tests/test_kook` fixtures/tests.
- `b711425b` is functionally absorbed locally. `MessageChain` carries `use_markdown_`, `derive()` preserves metadata through respond-stage splitting, and QQ Official switches to plain text when `use_markdown(False)` is set.
- `f86de988`, `094c2de8`, and `6982ef7d` are functionally absorbed locally. Discord startup survives command-sync daily quota (`30034`), Weixin OC raises on failed outbound media/text segments, and Weixin OC clears login/account state on session timeout.
- Lark/Dingtalk/Weixin OC one-click registration and the random platform ID suffix were already absorbed in the 2026-05-18 platform QR registration merge.
- Additional platform-adapter fixes confirmed present locally: `489e2a33` shared AppID hint text, `ffc31b30` QQ Official private active push without cached `msg_id`, `00ebebb1` QQ Official transient retries, `2f479b52` platform adapter filter types, and `e98eb92b` Telegram media-group scheduled job error logging.

Provider/WebUI experience review:

- Reviewed upstream `f0a1dd79` (provider config UI improvement) and `750597d` (model-add flow improvement).
- The broad provider config UI from `f0a1dd79` was already mostly rewritten locally: `ProviderChatCompletionPanel`, provider-source/model split panels, ChatUI `/models` workspace entry, provider config dialog wrapper, capability badges, and responsive provider page layout are present. The remaining unrelated ChatUI/layout/font subset churn was not re-applied.
- Completed the remaining `750597d` flow by wiring both `ProviderPage` and `ProviderChatCompletionPanel` to the existing `useProviderModelConfigDialog` composable. Clicking an available model now opens the model config dialog before saving, uses the narrowed model schema, and shares the same add/edit save path.
- Added a bounded scroll area for the available-model list to keep large provider model catalogs from expanding the provider page indefinitely.

## 2026-05-18 Platform QR Registration Merge

Reviewed upstream commits: `c88025c2` (dingtalk QR registration), `aace90da` (feishu/lark QR registration), `b991e819` (weixin_oc QR login), `8dde2292` (lark bot info), `a1e95081` (random suffix for weixin/dingtalk id).

### Absorbed

#### Dingtalk One-Click QR Registration

- New file: `astrbot/core/platform/sources/dingtalk/app_registration.py`
- Implements device code flow: init → begin → poll
- Returns `client_id` + `client_secret` on success
- Dashboard endpoint: `POST /api/platform/registration/dingtalk`

#### Lark/Feishu One-Click QR Registration

- New file: `astrbot/core/platform/sources/lark/app_registration.py`
- Supports Feishu (China) and Lark (Global) with automatic domain resolution
- Device code flow with `client_secret` fallback polling for Lark
- Returns `app_id` + `app_secret` + `tenant_brand` + `domain` on success
- Dashboard endpoint: `POST /api/platform/registration/lark`

#### Lark Bot Info Retrieval

- New file: `astrbot/core/platform/sources/lark/bot_info.py`
- After QR registration success, fetches bot name and open_id via tenant access token
- Integrated into lark registration handler for enriched response

#### Weixin OC QR Login

- New file: `astrbot/core/platform/sources/weixin_oc/login_registration.py`
- Uses existing `WeixinOCClient` for API calls
- Returns `weixin_oc_token` + `account_id` + `base_url` + `user_id` on success
- Dashboard endpoint: `POST /api/platform/registration/weixin_oc`

#### Dashboard Registration Endpoint

- Modified: `astrbot/dashboard/routes/platform.py`
- Added `POST /api/platform/registration/<platform_type>` endpoint
- Three handler methods: `_handle_lark_registration`, `_handle_dingtalk_registration`, `_handle_weixin_oc_registration`
- Random 4-letter suffix appended to platform ID on success (prevents duplicate IDs)

#### Frontend Registration Component

- New file: `dashboard/src/components/platform/PlatformRegistrationAction.vue`
- QR code display with polling state machine (idle → starting → pending → created/error)
- Auto-fills platform config credentials on success
- **Bug fix vs upstream**: local `QrCodeViewer` always re-encodes input as QR code via `QRCode.toDataURL()`. Weixin OC returns a base64 PNG image directly. Added `isBase64Image` computed property to bypass `QrCodeViewer` for base64 images.

#### Frontend AddNewPlatform Integration

- Modified: `dashboard/src/components/platform/AddNewPlatform.vue`
- Lark/Dingtalk: scan vs manual creation mode radio switch
- Weixin OC: direct QR display (no manual mode)
- `canSave` requires mode selection for lark/dingtalk; requires `weixin_oc_token` for weixin_oc
- `handlePlatformRegistrationCreated` appends suffix to platform ID on success
- `resetForm` clears creation modes

#### i18n

- Modified: `dashboard/src/i18n/locales/zh-CN/features/platform.json`
- Modified: `dashboard/src/i18n/locales/en-US/features/platform.json`
- Modified: `dashboard/src/i18n/locales/ru-RU/features/platform.json`
- Added `registrationAction` section with status texts, mode labels, and per-platform titles

### Not Merged

#### Test Files

- `tests/test_dingtalk_app_registration.py`
- `tests/test_lark_app_registration.py`
- `tests/test_weixin_oc_login_registration.py`
- `tests/test_discord_command_sync.py`
- `tests/test_cli_init.py`

Reason: Tests depend on upstream test fixtures and mock infrastructure that may not align with local test setup. Can be added later if test coverage becomes a priority.

## How to Update

- Add a new dated section for each upstream review.
- Record the upstream ref or tag that was reviewed.
- Separate decisions into `Not Merged`, `Deferred`, and `Already Absorbed`.
- For each skipped item, include the reason and the condition that would make it worth revisiting.
- Prefer linking to commit hashes, PR numbers, or file paths when available.

## 2026-04-27 Upstream Review

Reviewed upstream: `upstream/master` at `67c7445d` (`v4.23.6`)

Local strategy:

- Preserve the local prompt and memory architecture as the source of truth.
- Absorb upstream fixes only when they can fit this architecture with small, isolated changes.
- Do not merge changes that delete or overwrite the local `ContentPack -> Selector -> Render -> ProviderRequest` flow.

Already absorbed locally:

- Version bump to `4.23.6`.
- Firecrawl web search configuration and main-agent tool injection.
- SSL context compatibility using system trust store plus certifi fallback.
- OpenAI-compatible provider fixes for empty assistant messages, streaming sanitization, reasoning empty-string handling, and DeepSeek v4 reasoning history.
- Tool-loop reasoning preservation for empty reasoning content.
- Chat token stats display alignment: cached input tokens are shown separately from uncached input tokens.
- Existing local coverage already includes several upstream fixes: upload filename path traversal protection, backup importer path traversal protection, T2I raw text rendering, IME Enter handling, MiniMax WAV output, OpenRouter reasoning key, rate-limit count zero handling, RegexFilter pattern support, Telegram media group error handling, sandbox image download delivery, and SendMessageToUser workspace-relative file resolution.

### Not Merged

#### Prompt, Memory, and Postprocess Removals

Upstream deletes or reverts large local systems under:

- `astrbot/core/prompt/**`
- `astrbot/core/memory/**`
- `astrbot/core/postprocess/**`
- prompt-extension registration in `astrbot/core/star/context.py`
- memory lifecycle registration in `astrbot/core/core_lifecycle.py`

Reason:

These files are part of the local prompt/memory/postprocess architecture. Taking the upstream deletion would remove local context collection, prompt rendering, selector integration, memory services, prompt extension hooks, and after-send postprocess hooks.

Revisit if:

Upstream later introduces an equivalent or better architecture that can preserve local behavior, or if this fork intentionally drops the local prompt/memory system.

#### `astrbot/core/astr_main_agent.py` Wholesale Merge

Reason:

The upstream version removes local prompt pipeline integration, including `collect_context_pack`, `PromptRenderEngine`, `prompt_selector`, apply-visible/shadow pipeline modes, prompt trace extras, cached image/file extraction hooks, scaffold-free conversation save, and KB retrieval cache usage.

Local action taken:

Only the Firecrawl tool hook was cherry-picked into the local implementation.

Revisit if:

There is a specific independent bug fix in this file that can be extracted without changing the local prompt pipeline.

#### `astrbot/core/pipeline/process_stage/method/agent_sub_stages/internal.py` Wholesale Merge

Reason:

The upstream version removes final prompt trace logging, removes clean conversation-save user message replacement, and drops `prompt_selector` from `MainAgentBuildConfig`. This conflicts with the local prompt audit and selector work.

Revisit if:

There is a narrow runtime bug fix that does not affect final prompt tracing, conversation persistence, or selector config propagation.

#### WebUI Inline Edit, Regenerate, and Thread Flow

Main affected areas:

- `astrbot/dashboard/routes/chat.py`
- `astrbot/dashboard/routes/live_chat.py`
- `dashboard/src/components/chat/Chat.vue`
- `dashboard/src/components/chat/ChatInput.vue`
- `dashboard/src/components/chat/MessageList.vue`
- `dashboard/src/composables/useMessages.ts`

Reason:

The upstream implementation is a large feature set around editing, regeneration, threads, checkpoint IDs, and WebUI history mutation. It conflicts with the local checkpoint/message format decisions and local attachment rendering work. A partial type-only compatibility fix was kept, but the feature itself was not merged.

Revisit if:

The fork decides to implement inline edit/regenerate/thread UX explicitly. At that point, design it against the local checkpoint and prompt pipeline semantics instead of taking the upstream patch wholesale.

#### ChatPoint / Checkpoint Formatting-Only Diff

Main affected areas:

- `astrbot/core/agent/message.py`
- `tests/test_conversation_checkpoint.py`

Reason:

The remaining upstream diff is mostly formatting or test-only churn around checkpoint message dumping. It does not provide enough behavior value to justify merging over local checkpoint semantics.

Revisit if:

Future upstream checkpoint work fixes a real behavior bug or adds a compatible checkpoint API.

#### Dependency Removals

Main affected file:

- `pyproject.toml`

Reason:

Upstream removes dependencies that are still relevant to this fork, including local provider and media features. Local policy for this review was to keep dependency declarations unchanged except for the version bump.

Revisit if:

A dependency is proven unused in this fork after checking provider registration, media/TTS/STT paths, and optional feature gates.

#### Volcengine Ark Provider Removal

Main affected areas:

- `astrbot/core/provider/sources/volcengine_ark_source.py`
- provider config defaults and dashboard provider-source mapping

Reason:

This fork keeps the Volcengine Ark compatibility work. Upstream removes the provider path, which would be a feature regression locally.

Revisit if:

The provider is replaced by a cleaner OpenAI-compatible path that fully covers local Doubao/Volcengine image and request-format behavior.

#### QQ Official Message-Level Markdown Control

Main affected areas:

- `astrbot/core/message/message_event_result.py`
- `astrbot/core/pipeline/respond/stage.py`
- `astrbot/core/platform/sources/qqofficial/qqofficial_message_event.py`

Reason:

This is a useful platform feature, but it touches message chain semantics and respond-stage behavior. The local respond stage also includes postprocess dispatch, so this should not be merged opportunistically.

Revisit if:

There is a platform-specific need for per-message markdown control. Merge as a dedicated feature with tests covering postprocess hooks and non-QQ platform behavior.

#### KOOK Role Mention Support

Main affected areas:

- `astrbot/core/platform/sources/kook/**`
- `tests/test_kook/**`

Reason:

The feature is large and platform-specific. It is potentially valuable, but it requires a dedicated KOOK adapter review and test run because it changes role caching, event parsing, message conversion, and test fixtures.

Revisit if:

KOOK role mention support is needed by users of this fork. Merge as an isolated platform feature.

#### Knowledge Base FTS5 and EPUB Support

Main affected areas:

- `astrbot/core/db/vec_db/faiss_impl/document_storage.py`
- `astrbot/core/knowledge_base/retrieval/**`
- `astrbot/core/knowledge_base/parsers/**`
- dashboard knowledge-base upload UI

Current status:

Absorbed after later review. Current local code includes FTS5-backed sparse retrieval with BM25 fallback, legacy `documents_fts` recovery, EPUB parser/upload/read support, blank-prompt KB retrieval skip, and RST/ADOC upload support.

Revisit if:

Upstream later changes retrieval ranking/storage semantics, adds a new document format, or introduces a migration that conflicts with local prompt KB caching.

#### `/stats` Command and WebUI Stats Feature Expansion

Main affected areas:

- `astrbot/builtin_stars/builtin_commands/commands/conversation.py`
- `astrbot/builtin_stars/builtin_commands/main.py`
- dashboard stats components and i18n

Reason:

Part of this feature already exists locally. The remaining upstream changes are useful but not urgent. The only small compatible display correction was absorbed.

Revisit if:

Conversation-level token usage command behavior needs to be aligned with upstream or exposed more clearly in the WebUI.

#### Clipboard Utility and Provider Config UI Refactors

Main affected areas:

- `dashboard/src/utils/clipboard.ts`
- provider-source UI composables and config UI files

Reason:

These are frontend quality-of-life refactors with conflict risk against local WebUI work. They are not required for the prompt/memory merge goal.

Revisit if:

The dashboard has copy-action bugs or provider config usability becomes a priority.

#### Test-Only and Fixture-Only Diffs

Examples:

- `tests/unit/test_upload_filename_sanitization.py`
- `tests/test_kook/data/kook_ws_event_group_message_with_mention.json`
- selected checkpoint and upload tests

Reason:

Some tests duplicate behavior already covered locally, while others depend on features intentionally not merged. They should not be added unless the corresponding behavior is merged.

Revisit if:

The related production code is merged or changed locally.

## 2026-09-26 Recent Upstream Review

Reviewed local official snapshot: `upstream/master` at `26ff7673f53245043718d5121153bcd2a46b3a75` (2026-09-25). Fetching a newer ref on 2026-09-26 failed because the GitHub connection was reset.

Absorbed by local rewrite:

- `763a5ee97`: future-task listing, editing, and deletion now require both the current UMO and the creating sender ID. Same-group ownership failures are explained clearly; creatorless Dashboard/legacy jobs are not falsely attributed to another member. The list only includes the caller's tasks and notes when same-session tasks are hidden.

Already equivalent locally:

- `1f940d153`: raw edit text is tried before decoded escape sequences (`be5bd430f`), with regression coverage for literal `\\n` and Windows paths.
- `dae7c24e1`: compatible OpenAI completions extract both `<think>` and `<thinking>` tags and preserve explicit reasoning fields.
- `f09760001`: Gemini streaming retains narration and reasoning emitted before a tool call in the final turn response.
- `8b5e24ba2`: proactive and cron turns derive plugin admission from the selected configuration snapshot.
- `28c6aef1e`: legacy naive SQLite datetime storage is retained for Core, Knowledge Base, and document models (`7bba141a8`).
- `54c98e8ac`: each OneBot V11 file segment is resolved with its own `file_id`.
- `081261664`: Xinference rerank failures propagate so retrieval can preserve fused results.

Deferred / not applicable:

- `344627354`: upstream fixes scroll anchoring when earlier history pages are prepended. Local ChatUI currently loads session history through a different non-paginated path, so this patch has no compatible insertion point.
- `67c74b7ed`: upstream adds compression in FastAPI static-file routes. This fork serves its Dashboard through Quart and `app.send_static_file`; defer until a Quart-specific implementation can preserve range, cache, and streaming semantics.
