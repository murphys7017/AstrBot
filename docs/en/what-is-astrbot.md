# What is AG99?

AG99 is the public project name used by this repository. Created by YakumoAki and based on AstrBot, it is a desktop-first, persona-first agent application with a continuously running conversation runtime: one Persona can retain bounded state across turns and delegate substantial work to a separate Core execution layer when needed. AG99live is AG99's body runtime for local sensing, immediate reactions, Live2D presentation, voice playback, and device interaction.

This page keeps the `what-is-astrbot` path for existing bookmarks and inherited links. The Python package, CLI, plugin prefix, and some configuration keys still use `astrbot` as a compatibility boundary; this repository is not merely an upstream AstrBot configuration fork. See [Project identity](/Yakumo/project-identity) for the full boundary. Yakumo is the author's name, not the project name.

## Core Flow

The AG99 desktop application organizes the user entry point, Persona, sessions, memory, proactive behavior, tools, and unified management experience. Messaging platforms, the WebUI, and the CLI remain supported input or deployment forms; AG99live connects as the body and does not duplicate Persona, Memory, or proactive policy.

```text
Platform Adapter
  -> EventBus / Pipeline / Handler
  -> Interaction Middleware
  -> Personal Runtime + Personal Response Plan
  -> Core Planner (delegated turns only)
  -> Core Head / Core Execution
  -> Persona Expression
  -> Output Runtime
  -> Conversation / Memory
```

Normal messages and bounded unaddressed group candidates enter Interaction Middleware. Personal Runtime owns turn admission and session state. One structured Persona response plan returns `reply`, `delegate`, or (only for an eligible group candidate) `silent`:

- `reply`: complete the visible response in Personal without starting Core.
- `delegate`: send one natural, brief acknowledgement, then let Core Planner prepare the delegated work for Core tools, knowledge, Skills, and other substantial work.
- `silent`: emit no visible output; it is available only to eligible group candidates.

Core Planner does not make a second admission decision: it only prepares an executable `CoreTaskSpec` for a delegated turn. The Core Head coordinates task, event, cancellation, and execution lifecycle in-process. It is currently a synchronous entry point: it does not create a separate queue or send platform messages directly. Core results never bypass Persona Expression. Immediate replies, plugin persona output, and Core-final results share one visible-language and output boundary.

## Plugin Participation

- Pipeline Handlers retain ownership of keywords, commands, and protocol events.
- Prompt Extensions contribute target-scoped structured facts; they are not LLM Tools.
- Executable plugin tools default to Core and enter Persona only through explicit declaration or user configuration.
- Persona Effects are a structured presentation protocol; plugins interpret concrete Motion or Live2D semantics.
- Runtime Sensors submit bounded, expiring structured observations and cannot submit user text, prompts, tool calls, or final copy.

## Current Status

Yakumo is under active development and real-path validation. For runtime behavior, follow the source and [current state](/Yakumo/current-state); `dev/` and `target-state.md` documents marked as plans or designs are not completion claims.
